# About reading

I like reading (math and CS) papers that are
equipped with philosophical historical depth.

# About language

I enjoy the feeling of creating a language,
Including well designed OOP API.

# TODO React (DISLIKE)

In work I have to use React.js which is really inferior to Vue.js,
but I do not have the power to change the team's choice.
