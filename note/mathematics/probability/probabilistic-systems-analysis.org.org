*** formalize set theory

    - x -
      we found that to formalize mathematical structures
      the must important basic structure to be formalize
      is the structure of type -- or to formalize set theory

* intro

  - probability as a mathematical framework
    for reasoning about uncertainty

* probability-space-t

  - x -
    note that
    modern theory of probability
    is limited by the mathematical structure of probability-space-t

  - sample space -- set of outcomes
    we record which outcome is more likely to occur compare to others
    by assigning probability to outcome.

    but to deal with continuous sample space
    we must adjust our method by assigning probability to events
    where an event is a subset of sample space

    this definition also handles discrete sample space well
    by viewing assigning probability to sets of one element

  - outcome : sample space
    event = set of outcomes = subset of sample space

  - probability axioms

    - nonnegative -
      (A : sample-space) -> P (A) >= 0

    - normalization -
      P (sample-space) = 1

    - notations about set :
      | ^  | set intersection |
      | +  | set union        |
      | =< | sub set          |
      | >= | super set        |

    - additivity -
      (A ^ B = empty-set) -> P (A + B) = P (A) + P (B)

    - countable additivity -
      the additivity axiom need to be generalized to sequence of subsets
      instead of just two subsets
      (where sequence implies countable)

    the axioms looks like integration of some function over sample-space

  - extra notes about subsets of sample-space
    ignore ugly and weird subsets
    because for some weird subsets we can not both
    assigning probability to them and maintain probability axioms
    - x -
      this also revealed set theory's inconvenience,
      but why we are not using type theory yet?
      will type theory be even more inconvenient?

  - x -
    dealing with subsets remembers me of relational programming

  - discrete uniform distribution
    all outcomes be equally likely
    compute probability = counting

  - continuous uniform distribution
    probability = area

* zero probability

  - if we define probability by volume in n dimension unit space
    zero probability does not mean impossible
    zero probability only means n dimensional volume is zero

* conditional probability

  - the story goes like this,
    you know something about this uncertain world,
    and based on what you know, you build a probability model,
    by write down probabilities for different outcomes.
    then something happened, you get some new informations,
    you know more about the world,
    these new informations should change your beliefs
    about what may happen and what may not happen.

  - partial informations about random experiments and revise beliefs

  - P (A | B) := the probability of A, given that B occurred
    P (A | B) := P (A ^ B) / P (B)
    - given P (B) != 0
    - if P (B) = 0, P (A | B) is undefined

  - P (A ^ B) = P (B) * P (A | B)
    P (A ^ B) = P (A) * P (B | A)

  - with the above definition
    the proportion of probabilities in B is maintained
    suppose A1 =< B and A2 =< B
    P (A1 | B) / P (A2 | B) =
    P (A1 ^ B) / P (A2 ^ B) =
    P (A1) / P (A2)

  - we specify the probability model by a conditional probability tree
    instead of calculate conditional probability of a given model

  - P (A ^ B) = P (A) * P (B | A)

    P (A ^ B ^ C) =
    P ((A ^ B) ^ C) =
    P (A ^ B) * P ((A ^ B) | C) =
    P (A) * P (B | A) * P ((A ^ B) | C)

  - P (B) =
    P (B ^ (A + ~A)) =
    P (B ^ A) + P (B ^ ~A) =
    P (A) * P (B | A) + P (~A) * P (B | ~A)

    P (B) =
    P (B ^ (A1 + A2 + A3)) =
    P (B ^ A1) + P (B ^ A2) + P (B ^ A3) =
    P (A1) * P (B | A1) +
    P (A2) * P (B | A2) +
    P (A3) * P (B | A3)

  - P (A | B) = P (A ^ B) / P (B)
    can be interpreted as an inference problem
    suppose B, what is the probability of A

    - where P (A ^ B) and P (B) can be calculated
      by the above two sections
      which goes from P (B | Ai) to P (Ai | B)

    - bayes-rule :
      we know
      Ai => B -- P (B | Ai)
      we observe B, and we infer
      B => Ai -- P (Ai | B)

    - the => above can be viewed as
      causal relation in the sense of hume

* independence

  - P (B | A) = P (B)

  - P (A ^ B) =
    P (A) * P (B | A) =
    P (A) * P (B)

  - do not confuse independence with disjointness
    disjoint means
    P (A + B) = P (A) + P (B)

  - A and B are independent means
    the fact that A happens conveys no information about B

  - since conditional probability is probability
    independence can be generalized to conditional independence

    - x -
      conditional under B :
      (probability-space-t) -> probability-space-t
      conditional :
      (event-t, probability-space-t) -> probability-space-t

      - where a probabilistic-model is like one of our belief

  - for many events, independence is a very strong conditional
    we can also define pairwise independence
    - a weaker version of independence

* random-variable-t

  - random variable can be viewed statistically first
    - without introducing probabilistic-model

  - after we developed the theory of random variable
    we want to push probability space to the background
    only go back to it when really necessary

  - a random variable is a function from sample to number

  - random variable is used to specify subset of sample space
    on which we can calculate probability

    - x -
      the concept of function give us a handle
      to discuss more about probabilistic-model
      to express properties of what we are interested in

      - categorical pushout?

  - probability mass function -- for discrete random variables

    for continuous random variables
    we need probability density function

    where `sum-up` is changed to `integral`

  - x -
    the above formalization is rough
    we need to formalize set theory first

  - expected value -- center of mass

  - expected value of function composition

  - variance

* random-field-t

  - note the increasing number of sets here
    | sample-t | probability-space-t |
    | state-t  | random-variable-t   |
    | index-t  | random-field-t      |

* continuous random variables

  - instead of using probability mass function (PMF)
    we need probability density function (PDF)
    for continuous random variables

  - density is no probability,
    density is rate at which probabilities accumulate

  - to keep the over all probability equal to one,
    density at one point does not have to be less than one.

  - x -
    how to formalize continuous random variables?
    we may need to formalize integral first

  - cumulative distribution function (CDF)
    is well defined for both continuous and discrete random variables

  - PMF of discrete random variables
    can be viewed as impulse function (Dirac delta function)
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function

  - if a CDF is useful (such as normal distribution)
    we do not calculate it in close form
    we just tabulate it and use it

  - conditional PDF is normalized sections of PDF
    - normalized with infinitesimal as the dominator
      re-distribute over infinitesimal
