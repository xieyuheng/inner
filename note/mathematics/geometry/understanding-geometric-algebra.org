* 1 Introduction

* 2 3D Euclidean Geometry

*** intro

    - In this chapter,
      a vector is a geometric object
      equipped with direction and magnitude,
      not an array of numbers.

      Here, we present an "algebraic" description
      of 3D Euclidean geometry, representing objects by "symbols"
      and defining "operations" on them.

* 3 Oblique Coordinate Systems

* 4 Hamilton’s Quaternion Algebra

* 5 Grassmann’s Outer Product Algebra

* 6 Geometric Product and Clifford Algebra

* 7 Homogeneous Space and Grassmann–Cayley Algebra

* 8 Conformal Space and Conformal Geometry: Geometric Algebra

* 9 Camera Imaging and Conformal Transformations
