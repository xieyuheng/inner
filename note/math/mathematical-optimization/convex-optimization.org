#+title: convex optimization

* mathematical optimization problem

  - optimization variables:
    x = (x(1), ..., x(n))

  - objective function: f0(x)

  - constraint functions:
    f(i)(x) <= b(i) for i = 1, ..., m

  - mathematical optimization problem:
    find optimal solution x*,
    that minimize objective function,
    subject to constraint functions.

  - examples:

    - portfolio optimization:
      - variables: amounts invested in different assets
      - constraints: budget, max/min investment per asset, minimum return
      - objective: overall risk or return variance

    - device sizing in electronic circuits:
      - variables: device widths and lengths
      - constraints: manufacturing limits, timing requirements, maximum area
      - objective: power consumption

    - data fitting:
      - variables: model parameters
      - constraints: prior information, parameter limits
      - objective: measure of misfit or prediction error
