#+title: categorical models of dependent types

* links

  - my question :

* fibrations

  - https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/categorical+model+of+dependent+types

* operad

  - morphisms that have multiple sources
    (multiple targets are easy to encode using products).
    It’s called an operad.

* monoidal category

  - This looks more like a combination of composition and tensoring,
    in a monoidal category.
    Based on some stuff in a blog post :

    - https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2017/11/the_polycategory_of_multivaria.html

  - the cut rule is instead composition in a polycategory,
    and you can only cut out one type at a time.
