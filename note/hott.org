*** the groupoid model

    - types in intensional type theory with their identity types
      could be regarded as groupoids.

      - the 1998 paper of Hofmann and Streicher called
        "The groupoid interpretation of type theory"
        in which they showed that
        intensional type theory had a model in the category of groupoids.

      - "universe extensionality"
        and the univalence axiom of Vladimir Voevodsky

*** model categories and higher groupoids

    - The first higher-dimensional models of intensional type theory
      were constructed by Steve Awodey and his student Michael Warren in 2005
      using Quillen model categories.

*** The univalence axiom, synthetic homotopy theory, and higher inductive types

    - The concept of a univalent fibration was introduced by Voevodsky in early 2006
