title: Two approaches to the relationship between syntax and semantics -- initial and finial
date: 2021-09-02

The terminology "initial" and "finial"
come from category theory's [initial and terminal objects][].

[initial and terminal objects]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_and_terminal_objects.

The terminology was learned from Oleg's serial paper about [Tagless-final style][tagless-final],
for embedding DSLs in a typed functional host language.
