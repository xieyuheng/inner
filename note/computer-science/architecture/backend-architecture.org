* presentation layer

- controller should be very thin (almost not there)
- abstract away HTTP related stuff from layers under controller layer

* domain layer

** service layer

- responsible for request validation (to help domain models being typed)
- separate service class (use command pattern) for each endpoint
- might be able to generate controller from service

** domain models

- responsible for data storing and data integrity
