#+title: anomaly localization

* data cube

  attribute
  attribute_value

  indicator
  indicator_value -- additive

  itemset (element)
  - set of (attribute, attribute_value)
  - dependent pair

  cardinality
  - number of attribute_values occured during a time interval

  data_cube
  - hypercube whose coordinates are attributes
  - taken discrete values
  - values of an attribute might have no structure

  reduce one dimension
  - reduce a n cube to (n - 1) cube
  - we need additive indicator_value here
  - might be called "cuboid" but not sub_cube of data_cube
    for a sub_cube is a section of the data_cube

  data_cube.value : -- indicator, time, itemset -> indicator_value
  - this is the section
  data_cube.reduce : -- attribute -> data_cube
  data_cube.cuboid : -- set (attribute) -> data_cube

  anomaly localization problem :
  - itemset A is the cause of a data_cube's indicator I's change at time T, if
    lambda (time) = data_cube.value (I, time, A)
    changed a lot at time T
  - anomaly localization problem is to
    identify the most potential root cause
  - if a cuboid have anomaly at some time
    we need to find out which of its itemset is the cause
  - a cuboid's anomaly
    might have many itemsets as its root cause

  the measure of potential root cause
  - root_cause_score measures the potential
    of a subset of elements in a cuboid
    been the root cause of a anomaly
  - the score of elements are non-additive
    score ({e1, e2}) != score ({e1}) + score ({e2})
  - thus we need to calculate and compare
    all subsets for each cuboid in principle.

* hotspot

  - detect anomaly
  - forecast value of itemset
  - score
  - MCTS
  - hierarchical pruning
