How to Make a Complete Map of Every Thought You Think

## design

- small note with date and tags, maybe a title
- maybe a numbering system, like page -- surreal number -- with total order
  page number can not be reused,
  but we can insert new page between two pages -- revision-able
  - by having readonly page number we can link to other page in a stable way
  - about revision, actually a page can be of any length,
    so there is no need to insert page for revision,
    we only need:
    - to be able to reference the old version of a page
    - to view the revision history of a page
  - maybe we do need to insert page between,
    because we need total order, thus surreal number
- title help make clear the boundary of the topic,
  which will help retrieval at a later date
- note in context -- how to?
- colors -- red green blue black
- ruled papers
- templated papers
- sync to git
- how to handle link between pages?
  should link be directed or not?
- archival mark
