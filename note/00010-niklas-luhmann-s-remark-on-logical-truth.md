title: Niklas Luhmann's remark on logical truth

In Niklas Luhmann's view,
the difference between modern societies and early societies is that
the main principle of differentiation is functional.

Which means subsystems are formed based on their functionality,
such as politics, economy, research, military, eduction,
but not based on family / village, aristocracy / people and so on.

And because of this,
the concept of logical truth and reasoning
need to be upgraded for our modern societies,
and the semantics (reasonability) of a logic theory,
comes fron the implementation of its type theory,
and the act of using it to check (monitor and sanction) inferences (rules of role).
