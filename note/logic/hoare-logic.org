#+title: hoare logic

* [note]

*** mainly for imperative programming language

    - hoare logic is an extrinsic formal system
      to proof correctness
      of code written in imperative programming language.

*** ignore curry–howard correspondence

    - hoare logic is designed without respect
      to curry–howard correspondence.

* rules

*** empty statement

    -------------
    {P} skip {P}

*** assignment

    -------------
    {P[x=>E]} x := E {P}

*** composition

    {P} S {Q}
    {Q} T {R}
    -------------
    {P} S;T {R}

*** conditional

    {(and B P)} S {Q}
    {(and (not B) P)} T {Q}
    ------------------------
    {P} (if B then S else T) {Q}

*** consequence -- weakening

    P1 -> P2
    {P2} S {Q2}
    Q2 -> Q1
    --------------
    {P1} S {Q1}

*** while loop

    {(and P B)} S {P}
    ------------------------
    {P} (while B do S) {(and (not) B) P)}

* partial correctness

  - {P} C {Q} means :

    1. Whenever P holds of the state before the execution of C,
       then Q will hold afterwards,

    2. or C does not terminate.

  - termination needs to be proved separately.
    because In the latter case, there is no "after",
    so Q can be any statement at all.

    - Indeed, one can choose Q to be false
      to express that C does not terminate.
