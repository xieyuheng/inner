#+title: model theory

* the subject and aim of model theory

  - model theory is the study of classification of mathematical structures
    (e.g. groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory)
    by asking what logical sentences are true in them

    - x -
      this classification is different from
      the classification of objects in a mathematical structure
      (e.g. algebraic-topology)

    - x -
      what is the difference between model theory and category theory?
      since the aim of both is classification of mathematical structures

  - model theory recognises
    and is intimately concerned with a duality:
    it examines semantical elements (meaning and truth)
    by means of syntactical elements (formulas and proofs)
    of a corresponding language.

  - non-standard analysis is an example of model theory

* about classes in oo

  - model theory might be more than just classes in oo

    because we are not only interested in
    whether a sentence applied in a model is true or not

    we are more interested in
    deduction from true sentence to true sentence

  - a sentence is a type
    a set of sentences can define a class
    thus model theory study subclass relation between classes

* about constructive-ness

  - in constructive propositional logic
    "true" is defined as provable
    thus soundness is guaranteed

    if we need to handle syntax in the game of equivalent
    then we would need to prove soundness
    because equivalence between functions
    are defined as "same output for same input"

    if we do it this way
    is the game of equivalent still constructive?
    for the constructive-ness
    seems come from "free from interpretation"

* about type theory v.s. set theory

  - https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/model-theory/
    But in a broader sense, model theory is
    the study of the interpretation of any language, formal or natural,
    by means of set-theoretic structures,
    with Alfred Tarski's truth definition as a paradigm.

    - x -
      can we replace set theory with type theory
      in which a mathematical structure is just a class

* (1997) (wilfrid hodges) a shorter model theory

*** intro

    - model theorists study the sets definable in a single structure by a logical formula,
      just like algebraic geometers, who study the sets of points definable by equations over a field.

    'homomorphism'
    'substructure'
