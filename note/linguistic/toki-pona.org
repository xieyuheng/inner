* note
  a minimalism-primitivism-lang
  for to find the meaning of life

  it is difficult to separate language from
  thought and community
  with these come
  culture values and filters on how to interpret reality

  a	father
  e	met
  i	peel
  o	more
  u	food
  *consonants*

  syllables in toki pona follow this pattern:
  consonant + vowel + optional`n'

  the next syllable of the word begins
  with m or n
  there are four combinations
  which are not allowed
  due to the difficulty in either
  hearing or speaking them
  these are: `ji' `ti' `wo' `wu'

* toki pona word origins
  (Etymology of Toki Pona words)
  In most regards
  Toki Pona is an a *priori* language
  Its various words describe concepts that are unique to Toki Pona
  Just because a word was taken from another language
  for example, does not in any way imply
  that its meaning matches the meaning of word in the source language

* numbers
  The simple reality is that having words
  for every possible number is already a losing battle
  By their very nature
  numbers are infinite
  Name any number; a higher one exists
  *The higher and more precise you want to go*
  *the more abstract and disconnected*
  *from the present moment it becomes*

  ala	zero is the absence of something, meaning no.
  wan	one
  tu	two
  mute	several, many
  ale	all, infinite, also any overwhelmingly large number
  luka  which normally means "hand", can also be used for the number 5


  Word order
  Model: noun + number
  Place the number word after the thing you're counting.

  sike tu	two balls
  sike mute	seven balls
  mi	I, we
  mi wan	I (but not we)
  mi mute	we (but not I)

    ike jan li utala e ona mute

    jan ike ni li jo len nasa

    mi mute li moku e telo nasa mute

    jan lili li lukin e jan suli

    ona mute li nasa e jan suli


* lon, kepeken, tawa
  three words can be used as both
  a verb and a preposition

*** lon
    to be in/at/on
    to exist
    in, at, on

    ``mi lon tomo''
    ``mi moku lon tomo''
    ``suno li lon sewi''

***** using lon with ``wile''
      ``mi wile lon tomo''
      == ``I want to be at home''
      OR ``I want (to do something) in a house''

      ``mi wile e ni: mi lon tomo''
      == ``I want this: I'm at home''

      *e ni:*
      ``sina toki e ni tawa mi: sina moku''
      == ``You told me that you are eating''

***** using lon as an action verb
      lape (sleep)
      pini (stop, end)

      ``mi pini e lape sina''
      == ``I end a sleeping-you''
      OR ``I woke you up''

      ``mi lon e sina''
      == ``I made you aware of reality''
      == ``I forced you to be to present and alert''
      OR ``I woke you up''

      *NOTE*
      you could not say ``sina lon e mi''
      ``mi lon e sina'' only works because
      to the waker
      it seems as if the sleeper is not present
      in the waker's reality
      the sleeper seems absent
      and so waking him up brings him into
      the waker's reality

*** kepeken
    to use
    with, using

***** as an action verb
      ``mi kepeken e ilo''
      ==  ``I'm using tools''

      ``sina wile kepeken e ilo''
      == ``You have to use tools''

      ``mi kepeken e poki ni''
      == ``I'm using that cup''

***** as a preposition
      ``mi moku kepeken ilo moku''
      == ``I eat using a fork/spoon/any type of eating utensil.''

      ``mi lukin kepeken ilo suno''
      == ``I look using a flashlight''
      (ilo suno = a tool of light, hence flashlight)

*** tawa
    to go to, to move
    to, for

***** as a verb
      ``mi tawa tomo mi''

      ``ona mute li tawa utala''

      ``sina wile tawa telo suli''

      ``ona li tawa sewi kiwen''
      == ``She's going to the top (of) the rock''

      The reason that lon and tawa don't have an ``e'' after them is that
      there is no object
      For example
      in the sentence ``I'm going to my house''
      the speaker simply went home
      He did not do anything to his house
      he just went to it
      If he had burned the house down
      or had tried to do something to it
      or affect it in some way
      then ``e'' would come after the verb
      Otherwise, no ``e''

***** using tawa to mean ``to''
      ``mi toki tawa sina''
      == ``I talk to you''

      ``ona li lawa e jan tawa ma pona''
      == ``He led people to the good land''

      ``ona li kama tawa ma mi''
      == ``He's coming to my country''

      *to say you like something*
      ``ni li pona tawa mi''
      == ``That is good to me''
      (or, in other words, ``I like that.'')

      ``ni li ike tawa mi''

      ``kili li pona tawa mi''

      ``toki li pona tawa mi''
      == ``I like talking''
      OR ``I like languages''

      Keep in mind that ``e'' can only come after the verb of the sentence
      Toki Pona does not use clauses
      So for example
      if you wanted to say ``I like watching the countryside''
      you could NOT say something like this:
      ``lukin e ma li pona tawa mi''
      It's best to split this into two sentences:
      ``mi lukin e ma. ni li pona tawa mi''
      == ``I'm watching the countryside. This is good to me.''
      Of course, you could choose to say this same sentence
      using other techniques
      we learned in chapter five:
      ``ma li pona lukin''
      == ``The countryside is good visually. The countryside is good to look at.''

***** using tawa to mean ``for''
      ``mi pona e tomo tawa jan pakala''
      == ``I fixed the house for the disabled man''

***** using tawa as an adjective
      ``tomo tawa''
      == ``car''
      (a more literal translation is "moving construction")

      ``tomo tawa telo''
      == ``boat, ship''

      ``tomo tawa kon''
      == ``airplane, helicopter''

***** ambiguity of tawa
      ``mi pana e tomo tawa sina''

***** tawa as an action verb
      ``mi tawa e kiwen''
      == ``I'm moving the rock''

      ``ona li tawa e len mi''
      == ``She moved my clothes''

*** and kama

***** used with tawa
      ``ona li kama tawa tomo mi''
      == ``He came to my house''

***** as ``to cause'' or ``to bring about''
      ``mi kama e pakala''
      == ``I caused an accident''

      ``sina kama e ni: mi wile moku''
      == ``You caused this: I want to eat''

      so one always split a sentence into two
      but not using clauses

***** It can also be used with infinitives
      to make a progressive-like effect

      ``mi kama jo e telo''
      == ``I came to have the water''
      == ``I got the water''

*** TRY
    I fixed the flashlight using a small tool
    ==
    mi pona e ilo suno kepeken ilo lili

    i like toki pona
    ==
    toki pona li pona tawa mi

    We gave them food
    ==
    mi mute li pana e moku tawa ona mute

    This is for my friend
    ==
    ni li tawa jan pona mi

    The tools are in the container
    ==
    ilo li lon poki

    That bottle is in the dirt
    ==
    poki ni li lon jaki

    I want to go to his house using my car
    ==
    mi wile tawa tomo ona kepeken tomo tawa mi

    They are arguing
    ==
    ona mute li utala toki

    sina wile kama tawa tomo toki
    ==
    you should come to the chat room

    jan li toki kepeken toki pona lon tomo toki
    ==
    people chat in toki pona in the chat room

    mi tawa tomo toki. ona li pona tawa mi
    ==
    i have be the chat room. i like it.

    sina kama jo e jan pona lon ni
    ==
    you will get friends there

* other prepositions

*** sewi, anpa, insa, monsi
    ``ona li lon sewi mi''
    == ``He is in my above''

    ``pipi li lon anpa mi''
    == ``The bug is underneath me''

    ``moku li lon insa mi''
    == ``Food is inside me''

    ``len li lon monsi mi''
    == ``Clothes are behind me''

    Although you might be tempted to use these words
    as prepositions
    they are actually nouns
    You have to use another preposition along with
    these words
    and ``mi'' is a possessive pronoun meaning ``my''
    So ``sewi mi'' means something like ``my above''
    or ``the area that is above me''
    And since these words are merely nouns
    you must still have a verb
    in the above examples
    ``lon'' is acting as the verb
    Don't forget to include a verb!

    Since these words aren't prepositions
    they are free for other uses
    just like any other noun/adjective/verb:
    *monsi as a body part*
    monsi can mean either the back or the butt
    *anpa as a verb*
    ``mi anpa e jan utala''
    == ``I defeated the warrior''

*** sama
    ``jan ni li sama mi''
    == ``That person is like me''

    ``ona li lukin sama pipi''
    == ``He looks like a bug''

    ``sama li ike''
    == ``Equality is bad''

*** tan
    ``mi moku tan ni: mi wile moku''
    == ``I eat because-of this: I want to-eat''

*** poka

***** as a noun/adjective
      ``ona li lon poka mi''
      == ``He is at my side. He is beside me''

      ``jan poka''
      == ``neighbor; someone who is beside you''

      ``poka telo''
      == ``water side''
      == ``the beach''

***** as a preposition
      ``mi moku poka jan pona mi''
      == ``I ate beside my friend''

      ``mi moku lon poka pi jan pona mi''
      == ``I ate at side of my friend''

      ``mi utala e jan ike poka jan nasa''
      == ``I fought an enemy with a drunk guy''

      ``mi utala e jan ike lon poka pi jan nasa''
      == ``I fought an enemy at the side of a drunk guy''

      in every sentence there is a main verb
      and other prepositions in that sentence
      is about the main verb

*** TRY
    My friend is beside me
    ==
    jan pona mi li lon poka mi

    The sun is above me
    ==
    sonu li lon sewi mi

    The land is beneath me
    ==
    ma li lon anpa mi

    Bad things are behind me
    ==
    ijo ike li lon monsi mi

    I'm okay because I'm alive
    ==
    mi pona tan ni: mi lon

    I look at the land beside my friend
    ==
    mi lukin e ni: ma poka jan pona mi
    (the poka is about lukin)
    mi lukin e ma poka jan pona mi
    (is the poka is about lukin?)
    mi lukin e ma lon poka pi jan pona mi
    (is the lon is about lukin?)

    People look like ants
    ==
    jan li lukin sama pipi

    poka mi li pakala
    ==
    My hip hurts

    mi kepeken e poki e ilo moku
    ==
    i'm using a bowl and a spoon

    jan li lon insa tomo
    ==
    Somebody is inside the house

* negation yes/no questions

*** negation
    ``mi lape ala''
    == ``I'm not sleeping''
    (literally: "I sleep not.")

    ``mi musi ala''
    == ``I'm not having fun''

    ``mi wawa ala''
    == ``I'm not strong''

    ``mi wile ala tawa musi''
    == ``I don't want to dance''
    (``tawa musi'' == ``move entertainingly'')

    ``jan ala li toki''
    == ``Nobody is talking''

    like ``nicht'' in Deutsch
    bu in the end of something

    *NOTE*
    Incorrect:
    ``ijo ala li jaki''

    Correct:
    ``ala li jaki''
    == ``Nothing is dirty''


    for
    ``ijo li ...''
    == ``∃x∈A: ...''
    (where A is depended by the context)

    ``<set:A> ala li ...''
    == ``∀x∈A: ¬ ...''

    so ijo is not a set which ala can deny

*** ale and ali
    despite the differences in meaning
    ala and ale / ali
    as adjectives are used the same way

    The word ali has been created fairly recently
    Before it, there was only ale
    ale and ala are very close in pronunciation
    so we create ali


    ``jan ali li wile tawa''
    == ``Everybody wants to travel''

    ``ma ali li pona''
    == ``All nations are good''

    Also like ala
    it's best not to use ijo and ali together:
    Incorrect:
    ``ijo ali li pona''

    for
    ``<set:A> ali li ...''
    == ``∀x∈A: ...''

    By the way
    ``ali li pona''
    is one of the Toki Pona proverbs
    if you didn't know that

*** yes/no questions
    ``sina pona ala pona?''
    just like Chinese

    ``suno li suli ala suli?''
    == ``Is the sun big?''

    ``len sina li telo ala telo?''
    == ``Are your clothes wet?''

    ``tomo tawa sina li pakala ala pakala?''
    == ``Is your car messed up?''

    ``sina ken ala ken lape?''
    == ``Can you sleep?''

    ``ona li lon ala lon tomo?''
    == ``Is he in the house?''

    ``ona li tawa ala tawa ma ike?''
    == ``Did he go to the evil land?''

    ``sina pana ala pana e moku tawa jan lili?''
    == ``Did you give food to the child?''

    ``pipi li moku ala moku e kili?''
    == ``Are the bugs eating the fruit?''


    wile -- Yes
    wile ala -- No

    lukin -- Yes
    lukin ala -- No

    ``sina sona ala sona e toki mi?''
    == ``Do you understand my talking? ''
    sona -- Yes
    sona ala -- No

*** tan as a noun
    ``mi sona ala e tan''
    == ``I don't know the reason''

    ==
    ``Are you using that?''

    ``sina ken ala ken kama?''
    ==
    ``Are you coming?''

* gender, unofficial words, addressing people, interjections, commands

*** gender
    ``mama meli''
    == ``mother''

    ``mama mije''
    == ``father''

    Specifying male or female is often unnecessary
    so why bother?

*** unofficial words

*** addressing people, commands, interjections

***** interjections
      toki == hello
      pona! == Yay!
      ike! == Oh no! Alas!
      pakala == funk!
      mu == sounds made by animals

      suno pona! -- Good sun!
      lape pona! -- Sleep well! Have a good night!
      moku pona! -- Good food! Enjoy your meal!
      mi tawa -- I'm going. Bye!
      tawa pona! -- (in reply) Go well! Good bye!
      kama pona! -- Come well! Welcome!
      musi pona! -- Good fun! Have fun!

    jan Mose o lawa e mi mute tawa ma pona
    Moses, lead us to the good land

    tawa pona
    ==
    good bye (spoken by the person who is staying)

* questions using seme
  just like in Chinese
  since we are using the rigid order of words
  to show the different meaning
  between the words in one sentence
  we can easily let ``shen me'' get different meanings
  by puting it into different positions

  ``seme li utala e sina?''
  == ``What attacked you?''

  ``seme li moku e kili mi?''
  == ``What is eating my fruit?''

  ``seme li lon poka mi?''
  == ``What is beside me?''

  ``seme li lon tomo mi?''
  == ``What is in my house?''

  ``seme li pona tawa sina?''
  == ``What is good to you? What do you like?''

  so the word order of sentence dose not change
  in a question

  ``jan seme li moku?''
  == ``Who is eating?''

  ``jan seme li tawa poka sina?''
  == ``Who went with you?''

  ``sina kama tan ma seme?''
  == ``Which country do you come from?''

  ``sina kama tan seme?''
  == ``You came because-of what?''

  ``jan seme li lon?''
  OR ``jan seme li lon ni?''
  == ``Who's there?''

  ``sina tawa poka jan seme?''
  == ``Whom did you go with?''

  ``moku li pona tawa ona''
  == ``He loves to eat''

  ``mi lon tan seme?''
  == ``I exist because-of what?''
  OR ``Why I am here?''

  ``jan seme li meli sina?''
  == ``Who is your girlfriend?''
