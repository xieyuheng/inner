** What is Enterprise application?

Enterprise applications are about
the display, manipulation, and storage
of large amounts of often complex data
and the support or automation
of business processes with that data.

** What is iterative develop-ment?

At the heart of iterative development
is the notion that you should deliver software
as soon as you have something useful to the user,
 even if it's not complete.
