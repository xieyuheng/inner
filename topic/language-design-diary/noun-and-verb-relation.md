"Not all "verbs" have a clear separation between
a single entity that is the subject or active entity that ought to own the verb's definition
and the secondary, passive subject entities that should not own the verbâ€™s definition."

If a noun's relation to a verb is passive,
the noun should not own the verb's definition.

For examples:
- `Exp.check(..., exp, ...)`, should be `Checker.check(..., exp, ...)`
- `Exp.evaluate(..., exp, ...)` should be `Evaluator.evaluate(..., exp, ...)`
- `Exp.infer(..., exp, ...)` should be `Inferrer.infer(..., exp, ...)`
