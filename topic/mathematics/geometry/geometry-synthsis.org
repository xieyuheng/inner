* note

  - ':' for subset (transitive)

  - algebraic geometry

  - construction might be more fine than hott
    function might be less fine than hott

  - 每個幾個中 equality 都是關鍵
    證明函數定義良好 證明運算律 都要用到

* affine

  - straight line
    parallel line
    similar triangles
    rational number

* projective

  - half plane
    infinite far line
