Parsing (syntactic analysis) is one of the best understood branches of computer science.
Parsers are already being used extensively in a number of disciplines:
in computer science (for compiler construction, database interfaces, self-describing databases, artificial intelligence),
in linguistics (for text analysis, corpora analysis, machine translation, textual analysis of biblical texts),
in document preparation and conversion,
in typesetting chemical formulae
and in chromosome recognition, to name a few;
they can be used (and perhaps are) in a far larger number of disciplines.

Parsing is the process of structuring a linear representation
in accordance with a given grammar.
This definition has been kept abstract on purpose
to allow as wide an interpretation as possible.

The "linear representation" may be a sentence, a computer program,
a knitting pattern, a sequence of geological strata,
a piece of music, actions in ritual behavior,
in short any linear sequence in which the preceding elements
in some way restrict the next element.

For some of the examples the grammar is well known,
for some it is an object of research,
and for some our notion of a grammar is only just beginning to take shape.

------

Parsing for anybody who has parsing to do:
the compiler writer, the linguist, the database interface writer,
the geologist or musicologist
who wants to test grammatical descriptions
of their respective objects of interest, and so on.
