    - Thomas Kuhn

    - paradigm shift
    - exemplar
      as an extremely useful tool
      in understanding the historical evolution
      of this branch [logic] of modern mathematics.

*** intro

    - a case-study in the employment of that Kuhnian tool
      for the historiographical
      and philosophical analysis of mathematics.

*** 1. historisches: traces from the past

***** intro

      - historical shifts in the delimitation of the subject.
        [formal logic]

***** [note] the principle of comprehension

      - The comprehension principle states :
        Given any property,
        there is a set
        which consists of all objects having that property.
