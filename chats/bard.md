My favorite math topic is geometry. I love the way that geometry uses
shapes and patterns to solve problems. I also find it fascinating that
geometry can be used to describe the physical world around us. For
example, geometry can be used to design buildings, bridges, and other
structures.

Here are some of the things I like about geometry:

* It is a visual subject. I love being able to see the shapes and
  patterns that I am working with.
* It is a creative subject. I love being able to use my imagination to
  solve problems.
* It is a practical subject. Geometry can be used to solve problems in
  the real world.

If you are interested in learning more about geometry, I recommend
checking out the following resources:

* **Geometry for Dummies** by Deanna Jump
* **The Art of Problem Solving: Geometry** by Paul Zeitz
* **Geometry: Euclid and Beyond** by Robin Hartshorne

I hope you enjoy learning about geometry as much as I do!
