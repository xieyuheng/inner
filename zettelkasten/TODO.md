# writing proof by hand

- if we use named clause, we can use the name to express choice, and write proof by hand.

# procedural reading

- the solver should explain its resolution strategy in "procedural reading" style.

# relational algebra & higher dimensional algebra

- we can do relational algebra in prolog,
  by saying along which logic variable
  (just like in SQL we join over a key).

  This means relational algebra is already a algebra
  in which we can product two element along different ways.

  We can borrow its syntax in higher dimensional algebra.

  - We should do low dimensional algebras first -- 0, 1, 2, 3.
