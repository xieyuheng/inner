john conway come up with fractran while trying to solve collatz conjecture:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#Undecidable_generalizations
collatz conjecture is actually a the programming language (a rewrite system):
- n => 2n -- if n mod 2 == 0
- n => 3n + 1 -- elsewise
a program in language is a number n.

there are two layers, we can view both of them as programming language.
program is the special part of the input to a rewrite system,
that we know how to program (express our intent).
if defined so, maybe n is not program, because we do not know how to program it.
but that is relative, onec we know how to program it, it becomes program.
just like a list of frac numbers is not program, if no one invented fractran.
