教条（Rule）的类型：

- 禁忌（Taboo）

  - forbidden，cursed，unclean.
  - 没有普世的禁忌，这里禁止的，总有那里允许。

- 法律（Law）

  - 由社会机构强迫执行。

- 标准，规范（Norm）

  - Group held beliefs about how members should behave in a given context.
  - We use them to define group identity and to enforce social control.

问题不是我们为什么违反这些教条，
问题是为什么我会遵循教条，
毕竟不遵循其实也没事。
