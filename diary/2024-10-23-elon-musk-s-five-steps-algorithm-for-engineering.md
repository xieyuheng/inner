elon musk's five steps algorithm for engineering
([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRsxLLghL1k)).

- (1) make the requirements less dumb,
  the requirements are always dumb in some degree.
  first reduce the number of requirements,
  otherwise you get the perfect answer to the wrong question.
- (2) try to delete the (process) steps,
  be not afraid to delete and put back in.
- (3) only then, simplify it.
- (4) any given thing can be sped up.
  but speeding up something should not exist is absurd.
- (5) to automate it.

the order is the key, imagine doing it backward:

- automate something,
- sped it up,
- simplify it,
- and delete it.

elon often doing it backward,
he get tired of doing it backward,
thus this five-steps algorithm.
