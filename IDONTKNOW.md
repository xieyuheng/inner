# Galois Theory

# Formal Concept Analysis

# Linear Logic

# Probabilistic Programming

# Lambda Encoding of inductive types

> Be really good at using lambda to encode inductive datatypes

- learn Aaron Stump's cedille: https://cedille.github.io
- learn Fu Peng's gottlob: https://github.com/Fermat/gottlob

Can be learned from here: https://fermat.github.io

# Homotopy type theory

# Equivalence between Recursive functions

Maybe impossible.

Also learn about using `fixpoint` as keyword.

infinite normal forms:

- boehm tree
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction
- read henk barendregt's lambda book

# Practical usage of Coq and Lean for proving theorems

Also learn CoC when learning Coq.

# Cubical Type Theory

# Coinductive datatypes

Not just record type?

# Graph based implementation of Lambda Calculus

To solve the following problem:

> Normal forms of Parigot numerals are exponential in size,

I already know how to implement interaction nets,
which are linear, but a good starting point.

Examples of formal semantics -- Knuth, 1970
PhD theses -- C P wadsworth, 1971
PhD theses -- R Statman, 1974

# A unified language

as I learn these, I found that
I'd better have a language to help me
unify the different notations used by different authors
-- a sexp-based lisp language.

Note that, implementing is the unifying force.

- Let's start from Lambda Cube and CoC.

I feel most papers are hard to understand.

Maybe I am stupid, but I have some thinking about this recently.

I think if I have a syntax-ly unified language,
and I can transcript the notations of hard to understand papers
into my unified language,
understanding will be easier.

because i will be actively testing my understanding during transcripting.
