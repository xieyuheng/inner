# Lambda Encoding of inductive types

Can be learned from here: https://fermat.github.io

https://github.com/Fermat/gottlob
https://cedille.github.io

# Equivalence between Recursive functions

Maybe impossible.

Also learn about using `fixpoint` as keyword.

# Practical usage of Coq and Lean for proving theorems

Also learn CoC when learning Coq.

# Cubical Type Theory

# Coinductive datatypes

Not just record type?

# Graph based implementation of Lambda Calculus

To solve the following problem:

> Normal forms of Parigot numerals are exponential in size,
> but a reasonable term-graph implementation
> should be able to keep them linear via sharing.

# Lambda Cube

Why complicated kinding?

# A unified language

as I learn these, I found that
I'd better have a language to help me
unify the different notations used by different authors
-- a sexp-based lisp language.
