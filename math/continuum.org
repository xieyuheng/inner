#+title: continuum

* intuition of continuum

  - the basic intuition we have about continuum is that
    given a continuum we can cut it,
    an the cutting edge would be one dimension lowwer.

  - to develop a intuitionistic view of analysis
    we might first ask what is the basic intuition newton used.

  - in our construction,
    should we separate counting from measuring ?

* motions and forces

  - x -
    how should we model motions and forces in our geometry ?
    motions and forces happen in geometry right ?

  - k -
    let's say forces are used to form theories to explain motions.
    and motions are geometry with time as one of its dimensions.

  - x -
    firstly, without any caring about the forces,
    we need a language to describe motions.

* measure

  - x -
    how can we bring measuring back into the model ?
