## Hi, I'm Xie Yuheng ^-^/

I am a programmer, and I work as a full-stack web developer.

I share my ideas about _programming_, _mathematics_ and _philosophy_
through my notes, projects, translations, and papers.

Right now I'm working on [**Cicada Language**](https://cicada-lang.org),
and [**Readonly.Link**](https://readonly.link).

Curious? Come to see my [**inner universe**](https://github.com/xieyuheng/inner).
