## Projects

### Cicada Language

Right now I'm working on [Cicada Language](https://cicada-lang.org),
both a *programming language* and a *theorem prover*.

Based on cicada, I want to build a wiki of formalized
mathematical theories, to flourish the ideas developed in the
*foundations of mathematics*, and serve as a bridge between computer
science and mathematics.

### EnchanterJS

Since I work as a web developer, learning about all kinds of tools
designed for web development is my daily routine.

After encountered [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and its amazing community,
I start bringing its artisan spirit and beautiful API to my team.

Hence [EnchanterJS](https://github.com/enchanterjs/enchanter)
-- a web (and console) application framework,
for TypeScript and NodeJs, emphasis on clarity and well typed API.

### LogicDB

While learning Logic programming, I started a project called
[LogicDB](https://github.com/xieyuheng/logic-db), to embed a
Prolog-like logic programming language in JavasScript and TypeScript.

### ty

[ty](https://github.com/xieyuheng/ty) can be used to write schema to bring TypeScript's types to runtime.

We can use ty schema to do validation and generate random data of certain type.

### Lowdim & cell-complex

[Lowdim](https://github.com/xieyuheng/lowdim) is about modeling low
dimensional (0, 1, 2, 3 maybe 4 dimension) topology and geometry.

[cell-complex](https://github.com/xieyuheng/cell-complex) is about
topological and geometric modeling in any dimension.
