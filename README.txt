Ones Inner Universe

I am 谢宇恒 (Xiè Yǔhéng).
I am a programmer.

I design and implement programming languages,
and wish to use one of them as formal deduction systems.

This inquiry is beautifully formulated by Vladimir Voevodsky as the following,

> A formal deduction system together with a correspondence
> between its components and objects and actions in the world of mathematical thoughts
> which can be used to formalize all subject areas of mathematics
> is called a foundational system for mathematics or "Foundations of Mathematics".

I am specially interested in the formalization of Algebraic topology,
and its applications in Geometric modeling.

- I am trying to find an algebraic definition of infinity groupoids
  that would satisfy the Grothendieck correspondence.

I am also specially interested in the formalization of Category theory,
and its applications in the design of programming language's type systems.

- Which links back to my language designs.
