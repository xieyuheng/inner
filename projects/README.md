#### Cicada Language

Right now I'm working on [Cicada Language](https://cicada-lang.org),
both a *programming language* and a *theorem prover*.

Based on my language, I want to build a wiki of formalized
mathematical theories, to flourish the ideas developed in the
*foundations of mathematics*, and serve as a bridge between computer
science and mathematics.

#### EnchanterJS

Since I work as a web developer, learning about all kinds of tools
designed for web development is my daily routine.

After encountered [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and its amazing community,
I start bringing its artisan spirit and beautiful API to my team.

Hence [EnchanterJS](https://github.com/enchanterjs/enchanter)
-- a web (and console) application framework,
for TypeScript and NodeJs, emphasis on clarity and well typed API.
