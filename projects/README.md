### Cicada Language

Right now I'm working on [Cicada Language](https://cicada-lang.org),
a *dependently typed programming language* and *interactive theorem prover*.

I want my language to serve as a bridge between computer science and mathematics.

Based on this language, I want to build a wiki of formalized mathematics,
to flourish the ideas developed in the *foundations of mathematics*.

### EnchanterJS

[EnchanterJS](https://github.com/enchanterjs/enchanter) is web (and console) application framework.
