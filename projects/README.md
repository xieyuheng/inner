#### Cicada Language

Right now I'm working on [Cicada Language](https://cicada-lang.org),
both a *programming language* and a *theorem prover*.

Based on my language, I want to build a wiki of formalized
mathematical theories, to flourish the ideas developed in the
*foundations of mathematics*, and serve as a bridge between computer
science and mathematics.

#### EnchanterJS

[EnchanterJS](https://github.com/enchanterjs/enchanter) is web (and
console) application framework.
