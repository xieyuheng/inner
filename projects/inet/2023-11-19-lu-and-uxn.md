# The spirit of uxn

A system **designed to be implemented**, with very little capabilities
just enough to draw some pixels on the screen.

The goal is to make as powerful an implementation
as an average computer sci student could implement over a weekend.

# Three lessons from Linux development

- (1) To write simple modular parts connected with clean interfaces.
- (2) When a program must fails, it must fail as noisily and as soon as possible.
- (3) Design for the future because it will be there sooner than you think.
