title: Procedural programming as macro system

For graph-based programming model,
we do not have a static syntax,
our syntax is actually a stack-based
procedural programming language
for building graph.

We can make the procedural part of the language more powerful,
so that itself is a general programming language.

Thus, what can be putted on the stack,
is not only ports, but also strings, numbers and objects.

Like in graph database, where a node in graph is a container,
in which there can be an object.
Maybe we can view our graph as container too.

For syntax of a graph-based language, it is obvious that
we need to use powerful computation to construct the syntax,
is this also true for other syntax?
For examples, more complicated one like cell-complex,
and more simple one like tree.
