When implementing login and register for [mimor](github.com/mimor-official/mimor),
I found that although I implemented them once for [pomodoro](github.com/xieyuheng/pomodoro),
but I still feel unfamiliar to them.

This is a waste of time and a problem.

The solution might be writing good documentation for fidb during it's development,
explaining the problem it solves and the ideas about solving them.

It is actually much cheaper to write documentation than to write code.
