Based on current circumstance, I believe P.
But although all my actions is based on my belief of P.
I am not even aware of the fact that "I am believing P".
Not until as time goes by, the circumstance changed.
Firstly I aware something is wrong,
then I ascribe the wrong to the fact that "I am believing P".
Only now P is explicit.


In a prover,
if a theorem is proven, it will alway be proven.
Adding new facts to the system will not disprove any proven theorems.

But how about I think A is useful,
but when I discovered some new facts about A,
I know that A is actually broken.
