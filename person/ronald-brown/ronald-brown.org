* from groups to groupoids: a brief survey (1987)

*** 1 intro

    - Brandt's definition of groupoid arose out of his work on
      generalising to quaternary quadratic
      forms a composition of binary quadratic forms due to Gauss.

*** 2 examples

    - In the theory of groups,
      two motivating examples are symmetry groups, that is, groups of automorphisms,
      and groups derived from paths in a space, that is, the Poincaré or fundamental groups.
      We find that these examples generalise
      to give ‘symmetry groupoids’ and fundamental groupoids.

    - example 1
      a disjoint union of groups.

    - example 2
      an equivalence relation R on X,
      with (x, y) (y, z) = (x, z) as groupoid product.

      for examples, coarse groupoid and fine groupoid.

      This consideration of an equivalence relation as a groupoid
      also suggests the utility of groupoids for studying quotienting constructions,
      particularly in cases where the quotient set X/R
      cannot carry the appropriate structure.

    - example 3
      group G act on the set X,
      (x, g) : (X, G) as element in the groupoid.

    - example 4
      study a geometry [a structure] by means of its group of automorphisms.
      [Klein’s Erlangen Programme]
      generalised to
      study a family of structures by means of its actions typed by the structures.
      for example, in fiber-space with projection (p : (E -> B)),
      where transports [iso between fibers] are typed by points in B.
      [so called symmetry groupoid of fiber-space]

    - example 5
      fundamental group of space
      - i.e. loop space
      generalised to
      fundamental groupoid of space
      - i.e. loop space with a set A of base points
        or just the whole path space when the set A is the space itself

*** 3 applications of the fundamental groupoid

    - to use groupoid to express van kampen theory in a better way.

    - orbit space

*** 4 the category of groupoids

    - the notation of object group or vertex group of groupoid.

    - The classification of groupoids up to isomorphism
      was early on found to be reducible to the classification of groups.

    - One of the features of groupoids
      is the variety of types of homomorphisms.
      For groups, we have basically monomorphisms, epimorphisms, isomorphisms.

      For groupoid homomorphisms
      we have similar terminology to that for functors,
      namely faithful, full, representative,
      and also a variety of other types
      such as quotient, universal, covering, fibration, and discrete kernel.

      It may disturb people to learn that
      the first isomorphism theorem fails for groupoids.
      But in fact these apparent difficulties and complications
      lead to a theory richer than that of groups, and with wider uses.

    - the coarse groupoid (X * X), where X = {0, 1}, denoted as J.

      - give element 'a' of groupoid G,
        we have unique homomorphism (f : J -> G) of groupoids
        such that f(i) = a.
        thus, J plays for groupoids the role
        that the infinite cyclic group Z plays for groups.

      - J with the two inclusions {0} -> J {1} -> J,
        it has properties analogous to the unit interval
        in the homotopy theory of spaces.
        So it is easy to write down a homotopy theory for groupoids,
        with notions of homotopy equivalence,
        covering morphism, fibration,
        exact sequence, and so on.
        [homotopy theory is enabled by unit interval]

    - Indeed the construction of covering spaces
      is nicely expressed in terms of the problem of
      topologising the object set of a covering groupoid G
      of the fundamental groupoid.

    - Fibrations of groupoids occur naturally
      in a number of ways in group or group action theory;
      the resulting exact sequences give results
      on the original group theoretic situation.

*** 5 some applications

*** 6 the classifying space of a topological groupoid

    - about the nerve of a small category [groupoid].

*** 7 structured groupoids

    - groupoid object G internal to a category C.
      [just as simplicial object]

*** 8 conclusion

    - it seems that the transition from group to groupoid
      often leads to a more thoroughly non-abelian theory.

      This is seen in the von Neumann algebra of a measured groupoid,
      which has also been thought to be appropriate for quantisation in physics

*** preface 2

    - W. S. Massey -
      this method of characterising various mathematical structures
      as solutions to universal mapping problems
      seems to be one of the truly unifying mathematical principles.

    - brown -
      is it possible to rewrite homotopy theory,
      substituting the word groupoid for the word group,
      and making other consequential changes?
      If this is done, is the result more pleasing?

*** preface 3

    - geometry -> underlying processes ->
      algebra -> algorithms -> computation

    - [about universal property]
      analogies are not between objects themselves,
      but between the relations between objects.

        分析的算數化 -> 拓撲公理

***** 1.1 Neighbourhoods in R

      - given (a : R), we say P holds near a, or is valid near a,
        if P holds for all points in some neighbourhood of a.

        There is no notion of absolute nearness,
        that is, of a point x being ‘near a’.

      - a set A determines the set of points of which A is a neighbourhood;
        this set is called the interior of A, and is written Int A.

***** 1.2 continuity

      - The function f is continuous at a
        if for every neighbourhood N of f(a),
        f^{−1}(N) is a neighbourhood of a.

***** note 關於實數理論

        我們幾乎沒法按照這種連續性的定義
        來證明一個被計算機實現的函數的連續性

      - k -
        我想在下這個論斷之前
        首先我們要知道 '實數上的函數' 是如何被實現的

      - x -
        實現實數函數的方式是
        (1) 潛在無窮精確的有理數域上的函數
        (2) 有限精度的實值函數 這就涉及到了誤差與數值分析
        我想
        當用集合論的語言來定義
        函數的連續性和可微性等等性質時
        就根本沒法用定義來驗證如此實現的函數的這些性質了

      - k -
        這就可以說成是 '不具構造性' 嗎?
        '構造性' 就被定義爲 '可用計算機實現'?

      - x -
        我想這些關於實數的理論
        其應用都將體現在數值分析中
        而數值分析中的概念與方法又需要用一個程序語言來實現
        考慮實現這些概念與方法時所使用的類型系統
        可能就能讓我們獲得一個 '具有現實意義的' 實數理論

*** chapter 6 the fundamental groupoid

***** note

      - the modelling of the geometry of pushouts of spaces
        by pushouts of groupoids.

      - analogies between topology and algebra
        are described by the language of category theory.

      - analogies between relations instead of objects.

***** 6.1 categories

      - from equations
        (f g = 1) and (g f = 1)
        we cannot deduce (f g = g f)
        since 1 may denote different identities in each equation

      - Here we already see the double use of the idea of category.

        (a) General statements about topological spaces and continuous functions
        can in many cases be regarded as statements of an algebraic character
        about the category Top, and this is often convenient,
        particularly when it brings out analogies between constructions
        for topological spaces and constructions for other mathematical objects.

        (b) The category PX of paths on X
        is regarded as an algebraic object in its own right,
        as much worthy of study as an example of a category
        as are examples of groups, rings or fields.

      - if f has a left and a right inverse,
        then f has an unique two-sided inverse.
        Such a morphism f is called invertible, or an isomorphism.

***** 6.2 construction of the fundamental groupoid

      - a functor from (category path-space) to (category groupoid)
        where equivalence class is defined by homotopy rel end points.

        | (path-space X)       | (groupoid X)       |
        | ((path-space X) x y) | ((groupoid X) x y) |

      - tree groupoid := ((number ((groupoid X) x y)) = 1) (for-all x y : G)
        space X is 1-connected := (groupoid X) is tree groupoid
        for example, a convex subset of a normed vector space is 1-connected.

        X and (groupoid X) are simple-connected :=
        path-component of X is 1-connected
        thus, any two paths in X with the same end points are equivalent.

        A groupoid G is called simply-connected
        if (for-all x y : G) (G x y) has not more than one element

      - proof of non-equivalent between two paths
        involves techniques for computing the fundamental groupoid.
        [or should we say this reversely?]

***** 6.3 properties of groupoids

      - the object groups of a connected groupoid are all isomorphic.

***** 6.4 functors and morphisms of groupoids

      - groupoid functor from (category topology) to (category groupoid)
        respect product and sum [or say, coproduct or union].

***** 6.5 homotopies

      - this section defines
        homotopy between two functions,
        and homotopy equivalence between two spaces.

      - A map is inessential if it is homotopic to a constant map,
        otherwise it is essential.
        [essential is a property of maps]

        A space is contractible if its identity map is essential.
        [contractible is a property of spaces]

      - to proof two maps of type (S1 -> (S1 * S1)) are not homotopic,
        we need to know that S1 is not simply-connected.

***** 6.6 coproducts and pushouts

      - a pushout is a square generated by a angle.

***** 6.7 the fundamental groupoid of a union of spaces

      - x -
        I can generalise van kampen theory to n-dim by the language of AT1.

*** chapter 7 cofibrations

***** 7.1 the track groupoid

      - the so called track groupoid
        is the groupoid of mapping-space (X -> Y)
        where objects are (f : (X -> Y))
        and arrows [morphisms] are (h : ((X * I) -> Y))

        to get groupoid from path-space,
        we use maps of type ((X * I * I) -> Y) as equivalent relation.

      - use the language of category
        to describe extension-problem
        and homotopy-extension-property.

***** 7.2 fibrations of groupoids

      - using lifting-property to define fibration of groupoid.
        (p : (E -> G)) is a fibration if it has lifting-property,
        #+begin_src scheme
        ((:x : E) (:b : (:x p = :y)) ->
         (:e : (:x = :y1)) (:e p = :b))
        #+end_src

      - while for group,
        (p : (E -> G)) is a fibration iff p is surjective.
        Thus groupoids have a richer theory than that of groups
        since there is a greater variety of morphisms of groupoids
        than there is of groups.

    - filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids

*** prerequisites and reading plan

    - the use in algebraic topology of algebraic colimit arguments
      rather than exact sequences that is a key feature of this book.

*** historical context diagram

    - The theory of groupoids and categories
      gets more complicated in higher dimensions
      basically because of the complexity of the basic geometric objects.
      Thus in dimension 2 we might take as basic objects
      the 2-disk, 2-globe, 2-simplex, or 2-cube.

      | 2-disks | crossed modules     |
      | 2-cubes | double groupoids    |
      | n-disks | crossed complexes   |
      | n-cubes | cubical w-groupoids |

      the cubical model leads to conjectures and then theorems,
      partly through the ease of expressing multiple compositions.

      the disk model leads to calculations,
      and clear relations to classical work.

      - an important part of the development of good mathematics is finding:

        (i) the appropriate underlying structures,
        (ii) the appropriate language to describe these structures,
        and (iii) means of calculating with these structures.

      - So the fundamental group of the circle
        is usually determined by the method of covering spaces.
        Of course this method is basic stuff anyway,
        and needs to be explained,
        but having to make this detour,
        however attractive the route, is unaesthetic.

***** 1.6 proof of the seifert–van kampen theorem (groupoid case)

      - What one would expect is that
        the proof would construct directly an inverse to the induced morphism.

        Alternatively, the proof would verify in turn that
        the morphism is surjective and injective.

      - The proof we give might at first seem roundabout,
        but in fact it follows the important procedure of verifying a universal property.

        One advantage of this procedure is that
        we do not need to show that
        the free product with amalgamation of groupoids exists in general,
        nor do we need to give a construction of it at this stage.
        Instead we define the free product with amalgamation by its universal property,
        which enables us to go directly to an efficient proof
        of the Seifert–van Kampen Theorem.

        It also turns out that the universal property guides many explicit calculations.
        More importantly, the proof guides other results,
        such the higher dimensional ones in this book.

***** 1.8 Higher order groupoids

      - Crossed modules had been defined by J. H. C. Whitehead in 1946
        in order to express the properties of the boundary map
        of the second relative homotopy group, a group which is in general nonabelian.

      - Whitehead’s highly original method of proof
        (an exposition is given in [Bro80]) uses knot theory
        and what is now called transversality,
        and has become the foundation of a technique called 'pictures',
        for which references are [BH82], [HAMS93]

      - Section 2.7 shows that
        crossed modules are also equivalent to ‘categories internal to groups’,
        or, equivalently, to groupoids internal to groups.

        This is important philosophically,
        because groupoids are a generalisation of equivalence relations,
        and equivalence relations give an expression of the idea of quotienting,
        a fundamental process in mathematics and science,
        because it is concerned with classification.

        We can think of groupoids as giving ways of saying
        not only that two objects are equivalent,
        but also how they are equivalent:
        the arrows between two objects give different ‘equivalences’ between them,
        which can sometimes be regarded as ‘proofs’ that the objects are equivalent.

***** note

      - The topologist J. H. C. Whitehead (1904–1960)
        was steeped in the combinatorial group theory of the 1930s,
        and much of his work can be seen as
        trying to extend the methods of group theory to higher dimensions,
        keeping the interplay with geometry and topology.

        These attempts led to greatly significant work,
        such as the theory of simple homotopy types [Whi50b],
        the algebraic background for which started the subject of algebraic K-theory.

    - to use crossed complexes, rather than chain complexes.

    - to get classical results such as
      the Brouwer degree
      and the relative Hurewicz theorem.
