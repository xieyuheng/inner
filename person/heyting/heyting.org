  - 直覺主義應該被批評
    因爲在談論存在的時候
    他們發現好像數學的研究對象並不真的存在於物理世界
    因此就強調這些對象是思想中的構造
    但是其實這些思想中的構造也是信息
    這些信息可以充分地用形式語言來表達

*** [note] 關於實數

    - 很大的篇幅都被用來討論具有構造性的實數理論了
      這樣做的錯誤有三

    - 第一
      所發展的實數理論與主流的實數理論很接近
      之所以需要這種實數理論
      是因爲 想要以算數化的方式處理 無窮小分析 [即 微積分]
      錯誤在於 作者沒有想到
      這種處理方式本身就是有可能用構造主義的方法來避免的

    - 第二
      作者意識到了構造主義理論於物理無用
      錯誤在於 此時作者不知反省
      作者也沒有意識到 古典的算數化處理也於物理無用

    - 第三
      如此發展下去的理論 完全失去了 數學的美感
      錯誤在於 此時作者不知反省

* (1974) intuitionistic views on the nature of mathematics

*** 1 introduction

    - logic is complicated and therefore
      unsuitable as a basis for mathematics.

*** 2 arithmetic

    - We have now constructed each number individually
      We are not yet able to make statements
      about every natural number.

      - Such a statement is usually formulated
        by means of a generalizing  quantifier:
        For every natural number n A(n) holds.

      - But a better formulation is:
        Let n be a natural number, then A(n) holds.

      - More explicitly:
        suppose that we have constructed a natural number n,
        then we can prove A(n).

    - We see that it contains
      the notion of a hypothetical construction.
      This notion is fundamental in mathematics.

      Almost every theorem can be brought in the form:
      Suppose that construction A has been performed,
      then we can also perform construction B.
      The proof of such a theorem consists in a construction
      which, joined to the construction A,
      yields the construction B.

*** 6 mathematics and language

    - how mathematics can be communicated?

    - We use language to influence
      the thoughts and actions of other people.

      When a mathematician writes a paper or a book,
      he intends to suggest mathematical  constructions to other people;

      when he makes notes to aid his memory,
      his future self plays the part of another person.

      Like any other use of language, the communication of mathematics
      is not immune for misunderstanding.

*** 7 applied mathematics

    - all conscious thinkings are applied mathematics.

    - Every science goes far beyond what is directly perceived.
      It constructs a mathematical  system
      into which the facts and their relations can be fitted.
