# Preface

The study of patterns of plausible reasoning is done in the manner of the naturalist:

- I collect observations, state conclusions,
- and emphasize the points in which my observations seem to support my conclusions.

# Chapter 12. Some Conspicuous Patterns

We have a classical elementary pattern of reasoning,
the "modus tollens" of the so-called hypothetical syllogism:

```
A implies B
B false
-------
A false
```

What happens if B turns out to be true?

A conjecture, verified in one more case, becomes somewhat more credible.

We have here a pattern of plausible inference:

```
A implies B
B true
-------
A more credible
```
