# Preface

The study of patterns of plausible reasoning is done in the manner of the naturalist:

- I collect observations, state conclusions,
- and emphasize the points in which my observations seem to support my conclusions.

# Chapter 12. Some Conspicuous Patterns

## 1. Verification of a consequence

We have a classical elementary pattern of reasoning,
the "modus tollens" of the so-called hypothetical syllogism:

```
A implies B
B false
------
A false
```

What happens if B turns out to be true?

A conjecture, verified in one more case, becomes somewhat more credible.

We have here a pattern of plausible inference:

```
A implies B
B true
------
A more credible
```

We shall call this pattern **the fundamental inductive pattern**
or, somewhat shorter, the "inductive pattern."

This inductive pattern says nothing surprising.
On the contrary, it expresses a belief which no reasonable person seems to doubt:
The verification of a consequence renders a conjecture more credible.
With a little attention, we can observe countless reasonings in everyday life,
in the law courts, in science, etc.,
which appear to conform to our pattern.
