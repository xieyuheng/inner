* dimension theory

*** 1 introduction

    - quoting poincare :
      "Of all the theorems of analysis situs,
      the most important is that which we express by saying that
      space has three dimensions.
      It is this proposition that we are about to consider,
      and we shall put the question in these terms:
      when we say that space has three dimensions,
      what do we mean?"

    - and :
      "if to divide a continuum
      it suffices to consider as cuts a certain number of elements all distinguishable from one another,
      we say that this continuum is of one dimension;
      if, on the contrary, to divide acontinuum
      it is necessary to consider as cuts a system of elements themselves forming one or several continua,
      we shall say that this continuum is of several dimensions."

    - why not quoting aristotle?
      "A line, on the other hand, is a continuous quantity, for it is possible
      to find a common boundary at which its parts join. In the case of
      the line, this common boundary is the point; in the case of the plane,
      it is the line: for the parts of the plane have also a common boundary.
      Similarly you can find a common boundary in the case of the parts
      of a solid, namely either a line or a plane."

    - because the devoid philosophy of

    - firstly, why not ask "does space real has three dimensions?"?
