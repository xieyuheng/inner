  * THE COLLECTED PAPERS OF GERHARD GENTZEN
    Edited by M. E. SZABO
    Sir George Williams University, Montreal
* on the existence of independent axiom systems for infinite sentence systems :1932:
*** notations and some lemmas
*** an infinite closed sentence system possessing no independent axiom system
*** construction of an independent axiom system for a given denumerably infinite closed linear sentence system
* on the relation between intuitionist and classical arithmetic :1933:
* investigations into logical deduction :1935:known:
*** 術語
    * natural deduction 自然演繹
    * sequent calculus 則式演算 [相繼式演算]
* the consistency of elementary number theory :1936:
*** reflections on the purpose andpossibility of consistency proofs
***** the antinomies of set theory and their significance for mathematicsas a whole
***** how are consistency proofs possible
      * There can be no 'absolute consistency proof'
        A consistency proof can merely
        reduce the correctness of certain forms of inference
        to the correctness of other forms ofinference
*** the formalization of elementary number theory
***** the formalization of the propositions occurring in elementary numbertheory
      * x : <number> (:x: is even number) -> y z : <number> (:y: + :z: = :x:) (:y: is prime) (:z: is prime)
        其中 "+" 之用 與 加法 在計算中的意義有衝突 邪
***** example of a proof from elementary number theory
***** the formalization of the forms of inference occurring in elementarynumber theory
***** derived concepts and axioms in elementary number theory
*** disputable and indisputable forms of inference in elementarynumber theory
***** mathematics over finite domains of objects
***** decidable concepts and propositions over an infinite domain ofobjects
***** the 'actualist' interpretation of transfinite propositions
***** finitist interpretation of the connectives OR, AND, EXIST and ALL in transfinite propositions
***** The connectives IMPLY and NOT in transfinite propositions: the intuitionist view
*** the consistency proof
***** the elimination of the symbols OR, EXIST and IMPLY from a given derivation
***** the reduction of sequents
***** reduction steps on derivations
***** ordinal numbers and proof of finiteness
*** reflections on the consistency proof
***** the forms of inference used in the consistency proof
***** consequences of the consistency proof
* the consistency of the simple theory of types :1936:
* the concept of infinity in mathematics :1936:
* the present state of research into the foundations of mathematics :1938:
* new version of the consistency proof for elementary number theory :1938:
* provability and nonprovability of restricted transfinite induction in elementary number theory :1943:
* fusion of several complete inductions :1954:
