# Construction grammar

A theory of linguistic knowledge.

Question: What a speaker know when they know a language?

Question: How linguistic knowledge are represented?

Question: How reverse engineer a speaker?

Level by level, a programmer can build modules to model linguistic knowledge.
dictionary + grammar?

Answer by construction grammar: A speaker must know constructions.
All the speaker know is constructions, nothing else.

Idiom or idiomatic expression motivates this claim.

- idiomatic expressions are everywhere.
- idiomatic expressions are more than fixed strings.

Idiom is higher level than grammar,
or say, idiom is like dictionary and idiom is also like grammar.

If we can model idiom, we can model other linguistic knowledges.

Idiom can be private, personal and peculiar (which is the etymology of idiom "idios").

Xie: In linguistic, just like in programming language,
we can use constructors to construct things,
but we can not use functions to transform things (counterexample?).

Question: What is a construction?
