# Architecture with Ashi Krishnan

Everything we do must either solve a problem or create a problem.
- creating problem is the domain of art,
- solving problem is the domain of engineering.

Solving problem is all about the questions you ask.
- What problem am I trying to solve?
- What is my input?
- What is my output?
- What is my test?
