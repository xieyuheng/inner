# Architecture with Ashi Krishnan

## Intro

When we think about software architecture,
we end up thinking about the finished product of it.

But in order to understand the finished product,
we need to learn about the continuous iterative process.

I provide a framework consists of a few questions,
that you can ask about your project, at every level,
which will help you break your project in to smaller pieces.

That is really what we do, when we do architecture.
We take the big problem statement,
and we break it up into progressively smaller pieces,
until they are small enough,
that we understand how to write the code.

## The framework

**Everything we do must either solve a problem or create a problem.**

Creating problem is the domain of art.

Solving problem is the domain of engineering.

Solving problem is a process that a problem solver goes through,
and it is all about the questions you ask.

(1) What problem am I trying to solve?

In the process of pursuit a software project,
it is very easy to end up solving problems other than the one you meant to solve,
solving problems that were not actually problems for anyone.

Keep the purpose in mind, and to keep asking
how you are serving the purpose at every level of the problem.

(2) What is my input?
(3) What is my output?
(4) What is my test?
