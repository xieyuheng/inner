# Reading "Implementation patterns" by Kent Beck

Which teaches us to think about "why we write programs in our styles?",
and by encouraging us to explain our styles (ways (beliefs)), let us learn from ourselves.

The patterns of explanation of a pattern might be the following:

- "I use this pattern as a way of saying ..."
- "This pattern is a way of saying ..."

The term "a way of saying" emphasis communication (communication with my fellow programmers),
which is the first for the three values: communication, simplicity and flexibility.

For example:

I use polymorphism as a way of saying,

"Give me an object have these methods (satisfy these axioms),
I can have a lots of generic methods implemented for you (generic proofs proven for you)."

- like typeclass, but explicit.
- like algebraic structure (or mathematic structure).

# Reading "Refactoring" by Martin Fowler

In this book, the author's writing style is "explaining himself as a programmer".
