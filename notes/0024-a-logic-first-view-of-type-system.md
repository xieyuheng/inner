title: A logic first view of type system

For intuitionistic logic, evaluation (proof normalization) can encode computation.

But for other type systems, evaluation might have surprising semantics.

We might take a "logic first" view,
to view encoding of computation as an accidental behavior,
thus, to view computation as secondary.
