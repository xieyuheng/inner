title: The principle of category theory

Let's think about the typical example of category theory practice.
We take a concept from set theory,
such as *empty set*, *singleton set*, *cartesian product* and *disjoint union*,
take its definition, and translate it in to relations between morphisms,
for the purpose of generalizing the concept in to a some what normalized pattern,
and observing the pattern in all kinds other domain of phenomena.

Thus the principle of category theory is:

> Category theory should be viewed as a tool to help us recognize patterns.

But category theory's "explanation via pattern"
should not be viewed as the ultimate explanation.

> Reality escapes all concepts -- Alan Watts

# Category theory in use

When Eugenia Cheng talk about her view of category theory,
She thinks, category theory help us to be clear about
in what context we are considering equivalence relation.

This is a very useful view, this is "category theory in use".

When we study categorical semantics,
we must use it to explain language implementation in useful ways.

We should not get the "categorical semantics" and stop,
we should get the "categorical semantics" and use it.
