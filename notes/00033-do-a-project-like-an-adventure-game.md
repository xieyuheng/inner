By "project" we specially mean software development projects and research projects,
often a project will require both software development and research.

Inspired by game play of [soul-like games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls).

We can do a project like a soul game.

For example, we can use _main quests_ and _side quests_ to organize our goals.

| My inner repo | In a soul game                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `topics/`     | The map of the world.                                   |
| `persons/`    | Other players.                                          |
| `todo/`       | Plans of quests (with and marks on the map).            |
| `patterns/`   | Well collected knowledges (e.g. armaments, skills, ...) |

When doing research, it is important keep our research goals (main quests) in mind,
and equally important, to explore beyond the preset goals (side quests).
