title: Do a project like an adventure game

By "project", I specially mean software development projects and research projects,
often a project will require both software development and research.

Inspired by game plays of [soul-like games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls).

I think we can do a project like a soul game.

# Quests

For example, we can use _main quests_ and _side quests_ to organize our goals.

When doing research, it is important keep our research goals (main quests) in mind,
and equally important, to explore beyond the preset goals (side quests),
the feedback during the progress of a quest

# Try to use the analogy

I will try to use this analogy in my inner repo.

| My inner repo | In a soul game                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `topics/`     | The map of the world.                                   |
| `persons/`    | Other players.                                          |
| `todo/`       | Plans of quests (with and marks on the map).            |
| `patterns/`   | Well collected knowledges (e.g. armaments, skills, ...) |
