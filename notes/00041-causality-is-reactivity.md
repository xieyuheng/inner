The idea that one variable can listen to other variables' changes,
and update itself according to given function (with some uncertainty),
-- i.e. the idea of [structural causal model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_model) --
is called [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming)
among programmers.

This idea is heavily used specially by programmers
who write website (frontend web developers),
where the contents on the web page
need to react to a user's inputs
and interact with the user.
