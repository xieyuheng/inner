Why we use logic to understand the world?

The core of logic is causation,
i.e. **cause and effect relation**.

So we ask, why we summarise our knowledge about the world
in the form of causation?

For example, it is harder for us to understand:

- Probability theory.
- Quantum mechanics.

Because we inductively learned that
this form of knowledge is useful,
it helps us predicate the future,
and the main data of the induction
are the cases where **we are the cause**.

After my action, I can consistently predicate its results,
and this kind of events happen many many times a day.

For examples:

- In physics, we use the concept of "force" to understand movement,
  that is where we try to use a cause -- the force, to understand movement.
