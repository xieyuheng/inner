title: Why lisp matters to me?

Because I want to design languages about:

- Cell-complex
- Formal concept analysis
- Personal knowledge expert system
- Different Logic systems
- Different computation models

And in the long run,
the most efficient way of doing so
is to embed languages in a meta language.

But in language other than lisp
where the syntax does not have a
faithful and direct standard representation,
the embedding is not satisfying in terms of syntax design.

While in lisp, there are developed methodologies
to make syntax design trivial.

This is why lisp matters to me.
