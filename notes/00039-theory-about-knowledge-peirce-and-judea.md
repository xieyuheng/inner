An update to [00006-peirce-s-pragmatic-theory-about-knowledge.md](00006-peirce-s-pragmatic-theory-about-knowledge.md),
after I learn Judea's work about causation.

- knowledge := fixation of belief.

- belief := that upon which a man is prepared to act.

  - What to be believed are causal relations,
    for example, I believe if I do `A`, it will cause `B`,
    and `B` is the result desired by me,
    thus I remember this causal relation
    as a function `f: A -> B`.

    - The performer of the function might be the nature.

      > If I setup the situation `A`, by nature's law,
      > (after some evaluation) `B` will be the resulting situation.

      This interpretation of function type is different from
      the constructive interpretation:

      > A function `f: A -> B`
      > is a way of constructing an element of type `B`
      > given an element of type `A`.

      Two interpretations are the same,
      if we view the the nature as a big computer.

- logic := the system (or language) in which we express our beliefs.

- judgment := an attitude that a person takes towards expressions.

  - when we come to know something, we are making a judgment.

- logic inference rule := formalized definition of judgment (belief).

- computation := directed changes (simulation of action).

- program := carefully prepared init state.
