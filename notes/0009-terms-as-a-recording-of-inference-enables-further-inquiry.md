When we have term to record inference, we are enabled to do further inquiry.

Example projects can be:

- Use Polya's "logic" to record how we solve problems.
  - e.g. Puzzles from "To mock a mockingbird"

- Use Sandi Metz's "logic" in "99bottles" to record how we refactor a program to make it easy to change.

These are like the recording method in cognitive psychology.
