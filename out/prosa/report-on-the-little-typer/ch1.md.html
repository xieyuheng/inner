## The Didactics of forwarding engaging examples

To introduce a new concept, first give many engaging examples.

## The Didactics of familiar concept

More formal concept should be introduced
after the introduction of the equivalent more familiar concept.
(Explain judgment as Laws in English is more familiar
than direct introduction of formal judgment.)

&quot;The Law of Tick Marks&quot; is an instance of the first form of judgment.
(Introduce instance first, then introduce class.)

## judgment

A judgment is an attitude that a person takes towards expressions.
When we come to know something, we are making a judgment.

person
expression
judgment -- attitude person take towards expression
evidence -- person&apos;s reason to believe judgment

这里的叙述就是故事性的，
其中凸显出了很多核心名词，
可以用来组织代码与思想。

## What not obvious should be further explained.

We want to ask the question
&quot;Is (cons &apos;ratatouille &apos;baguette) a (Pair Atom Atom)?&quot;,
but we have not explained the meaning of Pair,
thus we ask &quot;Is it obvious that ...&quot;,
and give reason to explain the meaning of Pair.

## Non Value is Neutral

in the implementation the concept of Value seems not used,
but it is used, because Non Value is Neutral.
This definition of Value is different from the implementation.
Not only this definition can be used to define Neutral later,
it can also provide us a handle to talk and think about Exp.

## Expressions that describe other expressions are called types.

This definition of type is very simple,
with a leading question, it is even more natural.
