    should we use polytopal-complex instead of cell-complex?

* 0 Introduction and Examples

  - part of the work (and fun) consists in seeing how intuition from life in
    three dimensions can lead one (i.e., everyone, but not us) astray: there are
    many theorems about 3-dimensional polytopes whose analogues in higher
    dimensions fail badly. Thus, one of the main tasks for polytope theory is
    to develop tools to analyze and, if possible, &quot;visualize&quot; the geometry of
    higher-dimensional polytopes.

  - x -
    in this book,
    vector in vector space are represented as column vector,
    and linear functions (e dual vector) as row vector.

* 1 Polytopes, Polyhedra, and Cones

* 2 Faces of Polytopes

  - x -
    a face of a polytope, is defined as
    a valid inequality of polytope.

    this feels good for facet,
    a facet corresponds to one valid inequality.

    but not for edge.
    because an edge might corresponds to
    infinitely many valid inequality.

  - x -
    the author uses valid inequality of vertex,
    to construct the vertex figure of a polytope,
    by moving the valid inequality toward the polytope a little bit.

    even my treatment of vertex figure for cell complex
    is more elegant than this.

  - Why is all this (poset order structure) interesting for us?
    Because we want to study the set of faces
    of a convex polytope, ordered by inclusion.

    - x -
      example poset order structure is set ordered by inclusion.

  - the face lattice is the proper framework to define
    combinatorial equivalence of polytopes.

    we define two polytopes P, Q
    to be combinatorially equivalent
    if there is a bijection
    (piecewise linear homeomorphism)
    between their faces
    that preserves the inclusion relation.

    i.e. P and Q are combinatorially equivalent,
    if and only if their face lattices are isomorphic.

*** 8.1 Shellable and Nonshellable Complexes

    - [polytopal complex]
      A polytopal complex (see Definition 5.1) is a finite, nonempty collection C
      of polytopes (called the faces of C) in Rd that contains all the faces of its
      polytopes, and such that the intersection of two of its polytopes is a face
      of each of them.

    - [pure complex]
      A polytopal complex is pure if each of its faces is contained
      in a face of dimension dim(C),
      that is, if all the inclusion-maximal faces of C,
      called the facets of C, have the same dimension.

    - [simplicial complex]
      A complex is simplicial if all its faces (equivalently, all its facets) are simplices.

    - [underlying set of complex]
      The underlying set of C is the union a of its faces.

    - x -
      the spanning tree algorithm gives the begining shelling of any graph.
      but shelling can have more edges than edges in the tree.

      the first stage of normalization of 2-dim manifold complex,
      is a shelling of the 2-manifold.

    - [shellable]
      A polytopal complex is shellable if it is pure and has a shelling.

    - when adding a new element to the existing shelling,
      then the intersection with what is already there must be
      1. connected
      2. pure (d - 1) dimensional

    - x -
      [about normalization of 3-dim manifold complex]
      first we try to union all the 3-cells into one 3-cell,
      pick one, adding others one by one,
      but we must ensure that,
      at each step,
      the unioned 3-cell
      can be views as a 3-cell,
      whose boundary sphere is attached to 2-skeleton of the space.

      what is preventing us from doing this for 3-dim manifold complex?

      (link v C)

    - [nonshellable example]
      a tetrahedron and the 3-cube have nonshellable triangulations.
