* six principles of humman immune system

  1. redundancy
     First of all, it cleverly uses redundancy
     by having millions of copies of each component
     -- leukocytes, white blood cells --
     before they&apos;re actually needed,
     to create a massive buffer against the unexpected.

  2. diversity
     And it cleverly leverages diversity
     by having not just leukocytes
     but B cells, T cells, natural killer cells, antibodies.
     The components don&apos;t really matter.
     The point is that together,
     this diversity of different approaches
     can cope with more or less anything
     that evolution has been able to throw up.

  3. modularity
     And the design is completely modular.
     You have the surface barrier of the human skin,
     you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system
     and then you have the highly targeted adaptive immune system.
     The point is, that if one system fails, another can take over,
     creating a virtually foolproof system.

  4. adaptation
     The product is completely adaptive.
     It&apos;s able to actually develop targeted antibodies
     to threats that it&apos;s never even met before.

  5. prudence
     It actually also does this with incredible prudence,
     detecting and reacting to every tiny threat,
     and furthermore, remembering every previous threat,
     in case they are ever encountered again.

  6. embeddedness
     What I&apos;m pitching you today is actually not a stand-alone product.
     The product is embedded in the larger system of the human body,
     and it works in complete harmony with that system,
     to create this unprecedented level of biological protection.
