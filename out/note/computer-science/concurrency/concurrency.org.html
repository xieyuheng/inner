* [note] difference between process and automata

  - &apos;process&apos; as in process calculi.

  - process as a special way of encoding states of automata.

* [note] about implementation

  - a process is a function of type (-&gt; Event -- Process)

  - a process is a function
    that can be stepped
    each step of the process is a state of the process
    process is a automata whose states are encoded by steps
    let&apos;s call them &apos;step-states&apos;

  - a process is a function
    that can be composed
    according to the natural of its step-states

* [note] primitivity prejudice

  - suppose :
    1. model-1 is more primitive then model-2
    2. model-2 can be reduced to model-1
    3. one can use model-1 to implement model-2
    4. it is meaningless to use model-2 to model-1
       because model-2 is already more powerful than model-1

  - when ever such reduction as (2) can be done,
    a theoretical author might choose to
    use the more primitive model in his study,

    regardless the fact that although (3) is possible,
    but in practice, such implementation might be :
    1. more complicate than direct implementation
    2. has bad performance

  - this kind of bad design decisions
    is called *primitivity prejudice*,
    which very often occurs in developments
    of mathematical theories.

*** intro

    - shared-memory (clojure) vs distributed-memory (erlang)

*** threads and locks

***** 1: mutual exclusion and memory models

***** 2: beyond intrinsic locks

***** 3: on the shoulders of giants

*** functional programming

***** [note]

      - 之前說過 一個常識是
        在電子計算機裏
        所有的計算都是由 改變計算機內存的狀態 來完成的

      - 現在看來
        如果想要 concurrency 與 parallelism
        就要抽象掉個常識

***** future and promise

      - x -
        promise 類似於 sequent 中的不定元

*** the clojure way

***** atom and STM -- software transactional memory

*** actors

***** intro

      - functional programming, avoids mutable state and share states
        actor programming, retains mutable state but avoids sharing states

***** [note]

      - x -
        傳遞信息的時候 symbol 這個數據結構如何處理?
        注意我們的 module system 是依賴這個數據結構的

***** 1: messages and mailboxes

      - a station handle messages sequentially.

      - when receiving messages,
        processes act asynchronously.

        Erik Meijer and Clemens Szyperski
        talking to Carl Hewitt
        about the actor model

***** 2: error handling and resilience

      - separating error handling out
        into a separate supervisor process.

      - linking processes

*** communicating sequential processes

      - Primitives
        - Events
        - Primitive processes
      - Algebraic operators
        - Prefix
        - Deterministic Choice
        - Nondeterministic Choice
        - Interleaving
