* [note] implementation of actor model

  - components of an actor :
    1. process -- return-stack
    2. store -- data-stack
       and local binding
    3. communication -- message-queue

  - axioms [interface] :
    1. send message to address
    2. create new actors
    3. specify how to handle next message

  - address binding
    - address is not assigned by system,
      and can not be controlled by programmers.
    - the local store of a actor
      can only includes addresses,
      that are provided when it was created,
      or that have been recived in messages.

  - [question]
    when sending a message to an address,
    will it be received by all actors bound to the address
    or only one of them?

    - x -
      we can event broadcast a message
      maybe the message also contains meta informations
      about how they should be sent.

  - [question]
    how does the actor model relates to python distributed system solutions like celery.

  - [question]
    use thread or process to implement actor?
    or something more light weight?

  - x -
    the purpose of implementing actor model
    is to write web app in jojo,
    in which strong concurrency is needed.

  - k -
    if so,
    we need to learn how web apps are written
    in existing actor model based languages
    such as io and erlang.

  - interface :
    - send
    - recv

  - one mail station which maintains a process pool.
    [should be thread pool, but python has no proper thread]
    each process [scheduler] in the pool maintains many actors.
    each actor has data-stack, return-stack and message-queue.

    when a actor needs to send message to other actors
    or create new actors,
    it send message to its scheduler
    which in turn send message to the station.

    a scheduler schedules its actors,
    and catches exceptions.

  - address and mailing :
    actor-id
    bind actor to address
    is an address a channel?
    a channel can be implemented a another actor.

***** intro

      - the nature of the computing elements
      - global synchrony versus asynchronous elements
      - the mode of interaction between&apos;computing elements
      - degree of fairness
      - reconfigurability and extensibility

*** 3 computation in actor systems

***** 3.1 defining an actor system

      - computation in a system of actors
        is in response to communications sent to the system.

      - communications are contained in tasks.

      - as computation proceeds,
        an actor system evolves to include new actors
        that are created as a result
        of processing tasks already in the system.

      - the configuration of an actor system is defined
        by the actors it contains
        as well as the set of unprocessed tasks.
