* definition

  - Arthur Samuel (1959)
    Machine learning study how to give computers the ability to learn
    without being explicitly programmed

  - Tom Mitchell (1998)
    well posed learning problem:
    A programm is said to *learn* from experience E
    with respect to some tesk T
    and performance measure P,
    if its performance on T as measured by P
    improves with more and more E

* supervised learning

  - right answers are given
    data are labeled

  - curve fitting problem
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting</a>

  - regression problem -- predict continuous function
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis</a>

  - classification problem -- predict discrete function

  - examples
    - image classification

* unsupervised learning

  - data are not labeled

  - find structures and relations in data

  - clustering problem
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis</a>

  - examples
    - google news clustering
    - language model -- learn to predict next word in a sentence
    - clustering people by genes
    - market segmentation for sells
    - cocktail part problem -- separate people&apos;s voices
    - image processing -- clustering pixels

* learning theory

  - theorems about when learning algorithm will work

* reinforcement learning

  - sequence of decisions

  - reward function -- train dogs

  - game play (game tree)

  - self driving car and robotic

* linear regression

  - learning-algorithm :
    -- training-set
    -&gt; h : -- x : feature -&gt; y : target
    where h is hypothesizes function

  - representation of hypothesizes
    h is represented by a linear function
    the linear function is represented by a list of parameter -- theta
    theta -- parameter of the model
    -- yoneda embedding of (single return value) linear function

  - cost function -- squared error function
    to fit a curve
    is to find out parameters
    so that cost function is minimal

  - gradient descent
    - batch gradient descent
    - stochastic gradient descent -- incremental gradient descent
      in one step, updating theta only using some (one) training data
      but in many steps, all the data will be made use of

  - normal equations -- solve theta in close form
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares</a>

  - feature scaling
    make sure features are on a similar scale
    to make gradient descent converge more quickly
    this is obvious to see on the contour map

    - mean normalization
      shift by mean
      scale by something like (1 / (max - min)) or (1 / standard-deviation)

  - debug gradient descent algorithm
    by ploting cost function where the x axis is the number of iterations

    - test learning rates from small one
      0.001 0.003 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 1
      roughly time 3

  - polynomial regression
    polynomial regression can be reduced to linear regression
    by choicing polynomials as features

    - feature scaling to 1 is important here

    and this method is not limited to polynomial terms
    any function can be used as a term

* logistic regression

  - to solve classification problem
    linear regression of course can not handle this well

  - in logistic regression we try to find hypothesizes
    with range in between 0 and 1

  - we use sigmoid function composed with linear function
    as new hypothesizes function
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function</a>
    logistic function is the most common sigmoid function
    there are also other kinds of sigmoid functions

  - hypothesizes value can be interpreted as conditional probability

  - decision boundary -
    we make classification decisions by probability 0.5
    since we are composing logistic function to linear function
    decisions tranlate to positive or negative
    of the inner linear function
    the decision boundary is still a linear line (hyperplane)
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane</a>

  - non-linear decision boundary
    we can use non-linear inner function
    to get non-linear decision boundary
    for examples,
    hypothesizes with term x^2 can give us circle decision boundary

    - thus knowledge about algebraic geometry is useful here

  - we need a new loss function to fit the training data
    loss (theta) = mean (one_loss (theta, x, y))
    in linear regression
    one_loss (theta, x, y) = half (hypothesizes (theta, x) - y)

    we can not use this one_loss function for logistic regression
    because it will not be convex

    new one_loss should be
    one_loss (theta, x, y) =
    if y == 1 {
    - (log (hypothesizes (theta, x)))
    } else if y == 0 {
    - (log (1 - hypothesizes (theta, x)))
    }
    or
    one_loss (theta, x, y) =
    - y * (log (hypothesizes (theta, x)))
    - (1 - y) * (log (1 - hypothesizes (theta, x)))

    - the one_loss function can be found
      by the principle of maximum likelihood estimation
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation</a>

  - alternative to gradient descent
    - conjugate gradient
    - BFGS
    - L-BFGS

  - reduce one classification problems with n classes
    to n classification problems with 2 classes
    this is called one-vs-all method

* regularization

  - we use regularization to avoid over-fitting

  - the problem of fitting

    - under-fitting -- high bias
      model ignoring data

    - over-fitting -- high variance
      the space of hypothesizes is too large
      fail to generalize to new examples
      for example, using polynomial of high degree

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting</a>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias–variance_tradeoff">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias–variance_tradeoff</a>

    - x -
      how to measure bias and variance?

    - we can keep degree of hypothesizes function small
      by penalizing coefficient of high degree terms

    - the idea of regularization
      is to add a square sum of all parameters to the hypothesizes

      which will make &quot;all parameters are small&quot; as a goal
      &quot;all parameters are small&quot; can be interpreted as
      &quot;the model is simple&quot;

    - we do the calculus and try to interpret the updating function again

    - for normal equation
      regularization can make non-invertible invertible

* neural network

  - for complicated non-linear hypothesizes

  - x -
    maybe good knowledge about algebraic geometry
    can also helps complicated non-linear hypothesizes

  - the problem is not only about non-linear
    it is also about really high dimension
    take image data as an example,
    the dimension of data is number of pixels
    which easily goes to 1000 * 1000

  - neuron -- logistic unit -- with logistic activation function
    parameters are also called weights

  - hypothesizes function
    layers of multi return value linear functions
    thus a layer is represented by a matrix
    - instead of a list of parameters
      which only represent a linear combination
    the output layer is still a linear combination

    computation of the final hypothesizes function value
    is called forward propagation

  - intuitions -

    - a neural network is like many logistic regressions composed together
      one logistic regression has explicit sets of features
      - by &quot;explicit&quot; I mean &quot;meaningful&quot; and &quot;interpretable&quot;
      while hidden layers of a neural network
      are like *neural network&apos;s own features*

    - the hypothesizes space is huge
      but still kept simple

  - neural network architectures
    different ways to compose functions

    - x -
      can we use algebraic topology to do architecture?

  - loss (theta) = mean (one_loss (theta, x, y))
    one_loss = [todo]
