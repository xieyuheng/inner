<pre>#+title: Regular Algebra and Finite Machines

- by John Conway, 1971

* 0. Preliminaries to the Moore Theory

  - for Kleene&apos;s algebraic theory of machines.
    we begin by formalizing the notionof machine.
    and present Moore&apos;s identification theory of machines.

  - finite machine [sequential machine] [Moore machine] [finite automaton]

    - machine
      machine .states
      machine .inputs
      machine .outputs
      initial-state
      (: :input (-&gt; state -- state))
      (: observe (-&gt; state -- output))

  - given a machine, observe it by input and output,
    [to get a specification]
    and construct a minimal machine,
    which has the same behavior as the original machine.
