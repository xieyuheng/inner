* I Modular Organisation of Compilers

*** 1 Phases and Passes

    - the parse tree :
      shows the structure of the program text,
      how the fragments of program join together
      to make up larger fragments,
      how those join to make still larger fragments and so on.

    - the symbol table :
      provides a correlation between
      all the different occurrences of each name
      throughout the program
      and hence provides a link
      between each name and its declaration,
      whether implicit or explicit, in the source text.

    - These two information structures
      are the most important milestones in the compilation process.

    - Compilation as a whole is an activity
      which first builds up information structures
      which describe how the program may be broken into fragments
      and how these fragments inter-relate,
      then extracts from these structures
      the information which is required
      in order to translate the program.
