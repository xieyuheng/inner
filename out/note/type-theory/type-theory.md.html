# The subject of type theory

Type theory appear in every aspects of knowledge,
when it appears, it always serves as a bridge between two other knowledge domains.

# The methodology of type theory

The methodology of type theory says,
when two subjects are related, we should study them together.

For examples,
- In programming language,
  without type theory, we study functions,
  with type theory, we study function and specification together.
  We design type system for the programming language.
- In logic,
  without type theory, we study inference rules,
  with type theory, we study inference rules and proofs together.
  We introduce the concept of **proof object** to enter into the domain of **proof theory**.
