A theory of linguistic knowledge.

Question: What a speaker know when they know a language?

Question: How linguistic knowledge are represented?

Question: How reverse engineer a speaker?

Level by level, a programmer can build modules to model linguistic knowledge.
dictionary + grammar?

Answer by construction grammar: A speaker must know constructions.
All the speaker know is constructions, nothing else.

Idiom or idiomatic expression motivates this claim.

- idiomatic expressions are everywhere.
- idiomatic expressions are more than fixed strings.

Idiom is higher level than grammar,
or say, idiom is like dictionary and idiom is also like grammar.

If we can model idiom, we can model other linguistic knowledges.

Idiom can be private, personal and peculiar (which is the etymology of idiom &quot;idios&quot;).

Xie: In linguistic, just like in programming language,
we can use constructors to construct things,
but we can not use functions to transform things (really?).

Question: What is a construction?
Answer (Adele Goldberg): A construction is a generalization of similarities (that the speakers have made).

Xie: But function is forming abstraction (like lambda abstraction).

If there is anything to the whole that
can not be figured out if the a speaker knows the parts,
the whole is a construction.

Xie: The value of f(x) is only known, after it is evaluated to a value.

A construction has non-predicable meaning.

A construction need to be remembered.

Xie: Function body need to be remembered.

Xie: This meaning of construction (construction of idiom) is more strict
than the meaning of construction in programming language.

A construct is an instance of a construction.

Xie: In Chinese, we often remember more than what we need,
and forget about the structure of a character or a word.
We are often surprised when we analyse the structure.

Xie: In linguistic, just like in programming language,
we can use constructors to construct things,
and when we study idiom, we found that,
we can also use functions to transform things.
we remember the function body, and do substitution.
