<pre>They see you as small and helpless;
They see you as just a child.
Surprise when they find out that a warrior will soon run wild.

Prepare for your greatest moments;
Prepare for your finest hour.
The dream that you&apos;ve always dreamed is suddenly about to flower.

We are lightning,
Straying from the thunder,
Miracles of ancient wonder.

This will be the day we&apos;ve waited for.
This will be the day we open up the door.
I don&apos;t wanna hear your absolution;
Hope you&apos;re ready for a revolution.
Welcome to a world of new solutions.
Welcome to a world of bloody evolution.
In time, your heart will open minds,
A story will be told,
And victory is in a simple soul.

Your world needs a great defender.
Your world&apos;s in the way of harm.
You want a romantic life; a fairytale that&apos;s full of charm.

Beware that the light is fading;
Beware if the dark returns.
This world&apos;s unforgiving, even brilliant lights will cease to burn.

Legends scatter.
Day and night will sever.
Hope and peace are lost forever.

This will be the day we&apos;ve waited for.
This will be the day we open up the door.
I don&apos;t wanna hear your absolution;
Hope you&apos;re ready for a revolution.
Welcome to a world of new solutions.
Welcome to a world of bloody evolution.
In time, your heart will open minds,
A story will be told,
and victory is in a simple soul.
