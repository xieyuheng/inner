<pre># Restructuring lattice theory: an approach based on hierarchies of concepts

## Abstract

Lattice theory today reflects the general status of current
mathematics: there is a rich production of theoretical concepts,
results, and developments, many of which are reached by elaborate
mental gymnastics; on the other hand, the connections of the
theory to its surroundings are getting weaker and weaker, with
the result that the theory and even many of its parts become more
isolated. Restructuring lattice theory is an attempt to reinvig-
orate connections with our general culture by interpreting the
theory as concretely as possible, and in this way to promote
better communication between lattice theorists and potential users
of lattice theory.

The approach reported here goes back to the origin of the
lattice concept in nineteenth-century attempts to formalize
logic, where a fundamental step was the reduction of a concept
to its &quot;extent&quot;.

  The &apos;reduction of a concept to its &quot;extent&quot;&apos; might denote set theory.

We propose to make the reduction less abstract
by retaining in some measure the &quot;intent&quot; of a concept.

## 1. Restructuring lattice theory

Lattice theory today reflects the general status of current
mathematics: there is a rich production of theoretical concepts,
results, and developments, many of which are reached by elaborate
mental gymnastics; on the other hand, the connections of the
theory to its surroundings are getting weaker: the result is
that the theory and even many of its parts become more isolated.

- **[Xie]**
  We need to restructuring other theories of mathematics.

This is not only a problem of lattice theory or of mathematics.
Many sciences suffer from this effect of specialization.

Scientists and philosophers are, of course,
aware of the danger of this growing isolation.

In [17], H. von Hentig extensively discusses
the status of the humanities and sciences today.
One consequence is his charge to &quot;restructure&quot; theoretical developments
in order to integrate and rationalize origins, connections,
interpretations, and applications.

In particular, abstract developments should be brought back to
the commonplace in perception, thinking, and action.

Thus, restructuring lattice theory is understood as an attempt to
unfold lattice-theoretical concepts, results, and methods
in a continuous relationship with their surroundings.

One basic aim is to promote better communication between
lattice theorists and potential users of lattice theory.

Traditional philosophy considers a concept to be determined
by its &quot;extent&quot; [extension] and its &quot;intent&quot; [intension, comprehen-
sion]: the extent consists of all objects (or entities) belonging
to the concept while the intent is the multitude of all attributes
(or properties) valid for all those objects (cf. Wagner [36]).

The approach reported here takes these
&quot;concept lattices&quot; as the basis and discusses how parts of
arithmetic, structure and representation theory of lattices may
be developed out of problems and questions which occur within the
analysis of contexts and their hierarchies of concepts.

## 2. Concept lattices
## 3. Examples
## 4. The determination problem

The concept lattice can be understood as a basic answer to
two fundamental questions concerning a context, namely
1. the question of an appropriate classification of the objects,
2. and the question about the dependencies between the attributes.

Hence an important problem is:
How can one determine the concept lattice of a given context (G,M,I)?

## 5. The description problem

Connected with the description problem is the basic problem:
How can one describe the concept Lattice of a given context (G,M,I)?

&quot;Good&quot; solutions of this problem are helpful for further
analysis and communication, especially with non-mathematicians.
The most communicative description is given by Hasse diagrams.
If we label in a Hasse diagram of L(G,M,I) the circle representing
({g}&quot;, {g}&apos;) by a name for g (g in G) and the circle representing
({m}&apos;, {m}&quot;) by a name for m (m in M), as in the examples in Section 3,
the diagram retains the full information about (G,M,I) because
gIm is equivalent to ({g}&quot;, {g}&apos;) &lt;= ({m}&apos;, {m}&quot;) by the theorem in Section 2.

Although Hasse diagrams are frequently used, it is surprising that
there is no &quot;theory of readable Hasse diagrams&quot;.
Drawing a Hasse diagram is still more an art than a mechanical
skill that even a computer can work out. Because of the absence
of a theory, we shall only discuss the development of a Hasse
diagram by an example.

## 6. From structures to concept lattices
## 7. Measurement
## 8. Completions of partial concept lattices
## 9. Further remarks

This restructuring of lattice theory
does not pretend to be complete in any sense.

Many ties of lattice theory to its surroundings have not been mentioned.
A comprehensive development of lattice theory
should integrate and elaborate much more: for instance,
- origins as in logic (cf. Rasiowa [28]),
- connections as in geometry (cf. Birkhoff [5]),
- interpretations as in computer science (cf. Scott [33]),
- and applications as in quantum mechanics (cf. Hooker [18]).

Especially, its significance to other mathematical disciplines
which is still considered to be the main source has to be clarified.

Besides the interpretation by hierarchies of concepts,
other basic interpretations of lattices should be introduced;
an important role is already played by the interpretation of lattices as closure systems.
Feedback will always be given by the communication with potential users of lattice theory.

Coming back to the initial question:
Why develop lattice theory?

we may conclude that there is no short answer.
The justification of lattice theory
arises from its place in the landscape of our culture in general.
