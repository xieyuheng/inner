* the concept of nature

*** 1 nature and thought

    - we can think about nature without thinking about thought.
      i shall say that then we are thinking ‘homogeneously’ about nature.

      - x -
        do not observe that we are observers observing things.

    - Of course it is possible to think of nature
      in conjunction with thought about the fact that nature is thought about.
      In such a case I shall say that we are thinking ‘heterogeneously’ about nature.
      In fact during the last few minutes we have been thinking heterogeneously about nature.
      Natural science is exclusively concerned with homogeneous thoughts about nature.

    - natural science is concerned with the terminus of sense-perception, the nature.

    - I also take the homogeneity of thought about nature as
      excluding any reference to moral or aesthetic values
      whose apprehension is vivid in proportion to self-conscious activity.

    - nature is disclosed in sense-perception as a complex of entities.

      ‘Entity’ is simply the Latin equivalent for ‘thing’
      unless some arbitrary distinction is drawn between the words
      for technical purposes.

      All thought has to be about things.

      We can gain some idea of this necessity of things for thought
      by examination of the structure of a proposition.

    - [a theory of proposition, a theory of the major part of language]
      Let us suppose that
      a proposition is being communicated by an expositor to a recipient.
      Such a proposition is composed of phrases;
      some of these phrases may be demonstrative
      and others may be descriptive.

      we have demonstrative phrases and descriptive phrases.
