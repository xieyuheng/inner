<pre>#+title: an intuitionistic theory of types: predicative part

- 1973

* intro

* 1. informal explanation of the primitive notions

*** 1.1 mathematical objects and their types

*** 1.2 propositions and proofs

    - proposition and datatype
      are two view of the same construction

      - when view a type as proposition
        we only care whether it is non empty

      - when view a type as datatype
        we also care about what its objects are

*** 1.4 cartesian product of a family of types

    #+begin_src jojo
    (: B (-&gt; A -- Type))
    (-&gt; (: :x A) -- :x B)

    (+fun b (-&gt; (: :x A) -- :x B)
      :x ...
      (note
        the author introduce this
        by so called &quot;explicit definition&quot;.
        it would be better be introduce by examples))

    (: a A)
    (: a b a B)
    #+end_src

*** 1.5 disjoint union of a family of types

    #+begin_src jojo
    (* (: :x A) :x B)
    (: C (-&gt; (* (: :x A) :x B) -- Type))

    (note
      this C is to demonstrate
      how should we construct the elements of a type
      which dependents on (* (: :x A) :x B)
      (note
        why this is important?
        because [:x C] is the general form
        of non trivial propositions?

        thus C is to demonstrate
        how to prove a proposition
        for objects of type (* (: :x A) :x B)

        it seems that
        to define a type constructor
        it is not sufficent to only prescribe
        how to construct its elements !

        because type constructor is not a type?))

    (note
      in this version of the paper
      the author does not use general combinators anymore)

    (: g (-&gt; (: :x A) (: :y :x B) -- (* :x :y) C))
    (+fun f (-&gt; (* (: :x A) (: :y :x B)) -- (* :x :y) C)
      tuple-spread g)

    (note
      (= (* (: :x A) (: :y :x B))
         (: (* :x :y) (* A :x B))))

    (+fun p (note left projection)
      (-&gt; (^ (: :A Type) (: :B (-&gt; :A -- Type)))
          (* (: :x :A) (: :y :x :B))
          -- (: :x :A))
      tuple-spread drop)

    (+fun q (note right projection)
      (-&gt; (^ (: :A Type) (: :B (-&gt; :A -- Type)))
          (* (: :x :A) (: :y :x :B))
          -- (: :y :x :B))
      tuple-spread swap drop)

    (note example
      R for real number
      (= R [(: :x (-&gt; Z -- Q))
            (-&gt; (: :m :n Z)
                -- :m :n add :x :m :x sub abs
                2 :m neg power LT)])
      here R is defined by Cauchy condition.
      the author is thinking about
      Bishop&apos;s constructive analysis.)
    #+end_src

*** 1.3 properties

    - a proposition valued function
      is called a property,
      or, in intuitionistic terminology, a species.

    - thus, we also call
      a type valued function
      a species.

    - if (: B (-&gt; A -- Type))
      then [a B] is the proposition that
      a belongs to the species B.

      we call B &apos;a species of objects of A&apos;

    - the term &apos;belongs to&apos; is used here,
      but it is different from &apos;:&apos;.

    - examples :
      3 : N   -- 3 is a natural number
      3 Prime -- 3 is a prime number

    - x -
      classcally &apos;natural number&apos; and &apos;prime number&apos;
      seems both are set.
      but, in type theory,
      the different notions of &apos;belongs to&apos; are explicit.

      - Bishop -
        meaningful distinctions deserve to be maintained.

*** 1.6 disjoint union of two types

    #+begin_src jojo
    (+ A B)
    (: C (-&gt; (+ A B) -- Type))

    (: d (-&gt; (: :x A) -- :x C))
    (: e (-&gt; (: :y B) -- :y C))
    (+fun f (-&gt; (: :z (+ A B)) -- :z C)
      (case :z
        A [:z d]
        B [:z e]))
    #+end_src

*** [note] disjoint union of two types -- broken symmetry

    - x -
      (* ...) is a type-constructor
      and it is also a data-constructor
      if (: a A) (: b B)
      then (: (* a b) (* A B))

      (+ A B) is a type-constructor
      but it is not a data-constructor
      [at least not in current semantic]

      we want to say
      if (: a A) (: b B)
      then (: (+ a b) (+ A B))

      but if we view (+ a b) as one value [object]
      we must introduce non-deterministic

    - k -
      There are several ways
      an algorithm may behave differently
      from run to run.
      1. A concurrent algorithm
         can perform differently on different runs
         due to a race condition.
      2. A probabilistic algorithm&apos;s behaviors
         depends on a random number generator.

    - and the nondeterministic algorithms
      are often used to find an approximation to a solution,
      when the exact solution would be too costly
      to obtain using a deterministic one.

    - in nondeterministic programming
      at certain points in the program (called &quot;choice points&quot;),
      various alternatives for program flow.
      Unlike an if-then statement,
      the method of choice between these alternatives
      is not directly specified by the programmer;
      the program must decide at run time
      between the alternatives,
      via some general method applied to all choice points.

    - some alternatives may &quot;fail,&quot;
      backtracking might be used.

*** 1.7 identity

    #+begin_src jojo
    (: I (-&gt; (: :x :y :A) -- Type))
    (: refl (-&gt; (: :x :A) -- :x :x I))

    (: C (-&gt; (: :x :y :A) :x :y I -- Type))

    (: g (-&gt; (: :x :A) -- :x :x :x refl C))
    (+fun f (-&gt; (: :x :y :A) (: :z :x :y I) -- :x :y :z C)
      :x g)

    (+fun f (-&gt; [:x :y] : :A, :z : :x :y I -- :x :y :z C)
      :x g)
    #+end_src

*** 1.8 Finite types

    #+begin_src jojo

    #+end_src

*** 1.9 Natural numbers

    - x -
      this section shows why the author uses &apos;C&apos;.
      it means
      whenever we defined a type-constructor or a type,
      we also need to prescribe how can we proof
      &apos;for all objects of such type, property C holds&apos;
      (-&gt; :x : [...] -- :x C)

      this is an implicit specification [or implicit aim]
      of the design of any prover,
      i.e. be able to capture mathematical induction.

    - k -
      and such type-constructors
      can be introduced un-conditionally.

      why?

      and what is the meaning of those data-constructors
      of a type-constructor?

    - x -
      can we reduce such user defined type-constructors
      to other fixed type-constructors?

      I sense broken symmetry here.

      if we view (-&gt; ... -- ...) as type-constructor
      it will be so special.

    #+begin_src jojo
    (+type N : Type
      zero : N
      succ : (-&gt; (. .ante N) -- N))

    (: C (-&gt; N -- Type))

    (: c zero C)
    (: g (-&gt; :n : N, :n C -- :n succ C))

    (+fun f (-&gt; :x : N -- :x C)
      (match :x
        zero c
        succ [:x .ante dup f g]))
    #+end_src

*** 1.10 Universes

    - the abstractions described so far
      still do not allow us to types and type valued functions.

    #+begin_src jojo
    (note
      the type of finie sequence of natural numbers)

    (* :x : N, :x F)

    (+fun F (-&gt; :x : N -- Universe)
      (match :x
        zero N1
        succ (* :x .ante F, N)))

    (note
      transfinite type)

    (-&gt; :x : N -- :x G)

    (+fun G (-&gt; :x : N -- Universe)
      (match :x
        zero N
        succ (-&gt; :x .ante G -- N)))

    (note
      if we use Universe to type
      the return value of above functions
      Universe must be close under type-constructors
      such as (* ...) and (-&gt; ... -- ...))

    (note
      although Universe is closed under many type-constructors
      but we can not have (: Universe Universe))
    #+end_src

*** [note] the use of Universe

    - x -
      the use of Universe seems un-natural to me.
      because the function body here contain so much informations
      but all these informations are lost.

    - k -
      the goal is &apos;every type is also an object of some type&apos;

    - x -
      we should get rid of those type valued function
      the type of whose return value is Universe.

      because all informations are sunk into this Universe.

*** 1.11 definitional equality

    - x -
      this means during unification
      we can and should do function call.

      or before pure unification
      we must try to reduce the term.

    - k -
      although it is called &apos;definitional equality&apos;
      the basic relation is actually directed.

    - principle -

    #+begin_src jojo
    a : A, A = B
    --------------
    a : B
    #+end_src

*** [note] lambda of type

    - x -
      we do not have lambda of type
      we can not do definition inductively without naming.

* 2 formalization of an intuitionistic theory of types

*** 2.1 terms and type symbols

    - the formal system we shell setup
      consists of a certain number of mechanical rules
      for deriving symbolic expressions of forms :
      1. a : A
      2. a conv b -- &apos;conv&apos; denotes &apos;converts to&apos;
         i.e. term reduce, computation.

    - thus we also have two kinds of rules,
      classified by conclusion type :
      1. term formation
      2. c

*** 2.2 variables

*** 2.3 constants

*** 2.4 rules for Pi -- dependent arrow

*** 2.5 rules for Sigma -- dependent product

*** 2.6 rules for Plus -- sum type

*** 2.7 rules for I

*** 2.8 rules for Nn

*** 2.9 rules for N

*** &gt;&lt;
