<pre># Invariance Under Isomorphism and Definability

- **[Xie]**
  Comparing how Martin-Löf talks about mathematics
  and how Vladimir Voevodsky talks about philosophy,
  I can sense some kind of personal disagreement between them.

  I am in line with Vladimir Voevodsky&apos;s attempt
  to develop categorical semantics (or more general algebraic semantics) for type theory.
