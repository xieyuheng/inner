<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">#+title: an intuitionistic theory of types

- 1972

* intro

* 1. informal explanation of the basic concepts

*** 1.1 mathematical objects and their types

    - objects are always with their types

    - a type is defined by prescribing
      what we have to do
      in order to construct an object of that type.
      [as Bishop&apos;s set]

      - x -
        not necessarily be able to write a predicate
        to decide whether an arbitrary object
        is of that type?

*** 1.2 propositions and proofs

    - proposition is type
      thus,
      a proposition is defined by prescribing
      how we are allowed to prove it.
      a proposition is true intuitionistically
      if there is a proof of it.

*** 1.3 cartesian product of a family of types

    - dependent arrow

    #+begin_src cicada
    B: (A) -&gt; type
    { (x: A) -&gt; B(x) } : type

    b(x: A) : B(x)
    b(x: A) = ...

    a: A
    --------
    b(a) : B(a)
    #+end_src

*** [note] schema

    - the author use the term schema to specify definition,
      which may be understood as
      general patterns of function body.

    - whenever there are multiple equations in the schema,
      branching in the function body must be used
      for example : (case) (cond) (match)

*** 1.4 disjoint union of a family of types

    - dependent pair

    #+begin_src jojo
    (* (: :x A) :x B)
    (: C (-&gt; (* (: :x A) :x B) -- Type))

    (note
      this C is to demonstrate
      how should we construct the elements of a type
      which dependents on (* (: :x A) :x B))

    (: d (-&gt; (: :x A) (: :y :x B) -- (* :x :y) C))
    (+fun f (-&gt; (* (: :x A) (: :y :x B)) -- (* :x :y) C)
      tuple-spread d)
    (+fun f (-&gt; (: (* :x :y) (* A :x B)) -- (* :x :y) C)
      tuple-spread d)

    (+fun f (-&gt; (* (: :x A) (: :y :x B)) -- (* :x :y) C)
      (* :x :y) {d} E)

    (+fun E (-&gt; (suppose (: :A Type) (: :B (-&gt; :A -- Type)))
                (* (: :x :A) (: :y :x :B))
                (: :f (-&gt; (: :x :A) (: :y :x :B) -- (* :x :y) :C))
             -- (* :x :y) :C)
      tuple-spread :f)

    (+fun p (note left projection)
      (-&gt; (^ (: :A Type) (: :B (-&gt; :A -- Type)))
          (* (: :x :A) (: :y :x :B))
       -- (: :x :A)))

    (+fun q (note right projection)
      (-&gt; (^ (: :A Type) (: :B (-&gt; :A -- Type)))
          (* (: :x :A) (: :y :x :B))
       -- (: :y :x :B)))

    (note example
      R for real number
      (= R [(: :x (-&gt; Z -- Q))
            (-&gt; (: :m :n Z)
                -- :m :n add :x :m :x sub abs
                2 :m neg power LT)]))
    #+end_src

*** 1.5 disjoint union of two types

    - disjoint
      thus can not be dependent

    #+begin_src jojo
    (+ A B)
    (: C (-&gt; (+ A B) -- Type))

    (: d (-&gt; (: :x A) -- :x C))
    (: e (-&gt; (: :y B) -- :y C))
    (+fun f (-&gt; (: :z (+ A B)) -- :z C)
      (case :z
        A [:z d]
        B [:z e]))

    (+fun f (-&gt; (: :z (+ A B)) -- :z C)
      :z {d} {e} D)

    (+fun D (-&gt; (: :z (+ A B))
                (: :d (-&gt; (: :x A) -- :x C))
                (: :e (-&gt; (: :y B) -- :y C))
             -- :z C)
      (case :z
        A [:z :d]
        B [:z :e]))
    #+end_src

*** 1.6 Finite types

    #+begin_src jojo
    :n Finite
    3  Finite
    (: C (-&gt; 3 Finite -- Type))

    (: c1 1 C)
    (: c2 2 C)
    (: c3 3 C)
    (+fun f (-&gt; (: :x 3 Finite) -- :x C)
      (cond [:x 1 eq?] c1
            [:x 2 eq?] c2
            [:x 3 eq?] c3))

    (note
      (= [0 Finite] Falsehood)
      (= [1 Finite] Truth))
    #+end_src

*** 1.7 Natural numbers

    #+begin_src jojo
    (+type N : Type
      zero : N
      succ : (-&gt; (. .ante N) -- N))

    (: C (-&gt; N -- Type))

    (: d zero C)
    (: e (-&gt; (: :n N) :n C -- :n succ C))

    (+fun f (-&gt; (: :x N) -- :x C)
      (match :x
        zero d
        succ [:x :x .ante f e]))

    (+fun f (-&gt; (: :x N) -- :x C)
      :x d {e} R)

    (+fun R (-&gt; (: :x N)
                (: :d zero C)
                (: :e (-&gt; (: :n N) :n C -- :n succ N))
             -- :x C)
      (match :x
        zero :d
        succ [:x .ante, :x .ante :d {:e} R, :e]))

    (+fun R (-&gt; zero C
                (-&gt; (: :n N) :n C -- :n succ N)
                (: :x N)
                -- :x C)
      (match :x
        zero [drop]
        succ [tuck :x .ante R swap :x .ante swap apply]))
    #+end_src

*** [note] type constructor

    - x -
      when defining a type-constructor,
      this type-constructor can be used to form dependent arrow,
      the author also shows carefully
      how to construct functions
      whose type is this dependent arrow.

      why?

*** 1.8 Reflection principle

    - x -
      this section is very important,
      for it shows what the author intend to achieve.

      and it shows that the use of type valued function
      is really flexible.

      and the so called Reflection principle
      is simply a closure principle.

    #+begin_src jojo
    (note
      equality between natural numbers)

    (+fun E (-&gt; [:m :n : N] -- Universe)
      (match [:m :n]
        [zero zero] Truth
        [zero succ] Falsehood
        [succ zero] Falsehood
        [succ succ] [:m .ante :n .ante E]))

    (note
      the Universe seems specially ad hoc here
      because this equality is treated in a better way
      in the published paper)

    :x : N -&gt; :x F

    (+fun F
      : (-&gt; :x : N -- Type)
      (match :x
        zero N
        succ (-&gt; :x.pre F -- N)))

    zero F == N
    zero succ F == (-&gt; N -- N)
    zero succ succ F == (-&gt; (-&gt; N -- N) -- N)
    ...
