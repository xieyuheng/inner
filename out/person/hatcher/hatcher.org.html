***** 1.3. Covering Spaces

      - covering spaces can be used to calculate fundamental groups of spaces.

        the fundamental group and covering spaces
        can be regarded as two viewpoints toward the same thing.
        Algebraic aspects of the fundamental group
        can often be translated into the geometric language of covering spaces.

        connected covering spaces of a given space X corresponds to
        subgroups of π1 (X).

        as a Galois theory, where
        field extensions corresponds to
        subgroups of the Galois group.

      - onto-map (: c (-&gt; A B)) is covering-map,

      - examples about S1 &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt; S1 :
        #+begin_src scheme

        #+end_src
