* homotopy theory (1959)

*** 1 main problem and preliminary notions

***** 1 introduction

      &gt; There is a general type of topological problem
      &gt; which will be called the extension problem.
      &gt; One of the principal objectives of the book is to show that
      &gt; this problem is fundamental in topology.
      &gt; It will be shown that many theorems of topology
      &gt; and most of its applications in other fields of mathematics
      &gt; are solutions of special cases of the extension problem.

***** 2 the extension problem

******* a low-level way to express the problem

        - the problem can be described as
          solving the following functional equation :
          #+begin_src scheme
          (&lt;equation&gt;
           (&lt;given&gt;
            g : (-&gt; A Y)
            inclusion : (-&gt; A X))
           (&lt;find&gt;
            f : (-&gt; X Y))
           (&lt;such-that&gt;
            (== [g] [inclusion f])
            (note
              &apos;A is a subtype of X&apos; is expressed by a named inclusion-map.)))
          #+end_src

        - by &apos;functional&apos;, I mean the solution of the equation
          would be a function, instead of lowest level data.

        - If the machine were to check, whether the solution I found,
          suffices the condition of the equation,
          it must be able to check, whether two functions are equal.
          I can not follow this way led by the author,
          because, in my prospect, the equality of function
          will be implemented by a special kind of extension-problem.

        - Thus, I use a low-level definition of extension-problem :
          #+begin_src scheme
          (let ([g (lambda (-&gt; A Y) ...)])
            (define f
              (lambda (-&gt; X Y)
                (extend-from g)
                ...)))
          #+end_src

        - Since a type is encoded by a list of its parts,
          I let subtype be encoded by a sub-list of the list of parts.

        - In an extension-problem,
          we extend a partial map to a total-map step by step,
          while maintain the continuity of the map.
          What the machine should be checking,
          is shifted from equality to continuity.
          Since we already established the rules for continuity-check,
          we can express extension-problem in my language now.

        - In the book,
          firstly, a restricted extension-problem is formed,
          but in my language,
          we always have the final version of extension-problem,
          i.e. equality between two functions,
          is understood as homotopy between two functions by default.

******* retraction-problem

******* retraction-problem &amp; extension-problem

        - if the retraction-problem
          is solvable by &apos;r&apos;,
          then every extension-problem
          is solvable by &apos;e&apos;.

          #+begin_src scheme
          (let ([r (lambda (-&gt; X A)
                     (extend-from (identity-map-of A))
                     ...)]
                [g (lambda (-&gt; A Y)
                     ...)])
            (define e
              (lambda (-&gt; X Y)
                (extend-from
                  (lambda (-&gt; A Y)
                    (-&gt; :a [:a g])))
                (-&gt; :x [:x r g]))))
          #+end_src

******* the proof of (== f0 f1)

        - to proof (== f0 f1)
          is to form a special extension-problem.
          with (f0, f1 : A -&gt; B)
          we need to extend a partial map of type (-&gt; [A I] [B])
          #+begin_src scheme
          (let ([f0 (lambda (-&gt; A B) ...)]
                [f1 (lambda (-&gt; A B) ...)])
            (lambda (-&gt; (* A I) B)
              (extend-from
                (lambda (-&gt; (* A (0 I)) B)
                  (-&gt; (* :a i0) [:a f0])
                  (-&gt; (* :a i1) [:a f1])))
              ...))
          #+end_src

        - the corresponding retraction-problem is
          #+begin_src scheme
          (lambda (-&gt; (* A I) (* A (0 I)))
            (extend-from
              (identity-map-of (* A (0 I))))
            ...)
          #+end_src
          if this retraction-problem is solvable
          then for all (f0, f1 : A -&gt; B)
          we have (f0 ~ f1)

******* the proof of (A == B)

        - the corresponding retraction-problem is
          #+begin_src scheme
          (lambda (-&gt; (* A I) (* A (0 I)))
            (extend-from
              (identity-map-of (* A (0 I)))))

          (note the-same-for B)
          #+end_src

        - to proof (A == B)
          is to form find (f : A -&gt; B) and (g : B -&gt; A)
          and to proof (f g ~ A id) and (g f ~ B id)
          #+begin_src scheme
          (lambda (-&gt; (* A I) A)
            (extend-from
              (lambda (-&gt; (* A (0 I)) A)
                (-&gt; (* :a i0) [:a f g])
                (-&gt; (* :a i1) :a))))

          (lambda (-&gt; (* B I) B)
            (extend-from
              (lambda (-&gt; (* B (0 I)) B)
                (-&gt; (* :b i0) [:b g f])
                (-&gt; (* :b i1) :b))))
          #+end_src

        - it is to say
          if the above retraction-problem is solvable
          then to proof (A == B)
          it is suffice to proof (A -&gt; B) and (B -&gt; A)
          [i.e. to find two functions of such types]

******* note

        - in the book, there is a semantic usage of space name :
          X -- domain
          A -- sub-domain
          Y -- co-domain

******* example

        #+begin_src scheme
        (define example-1
          (lambda (-&gt; X (0 I))
            (extend-from
              (lambda (-&gt; (list x0 x1) (0 I))
                (-&gt; x0 i0)
                (-&gt; x1 i1)))
            (note the above is solvable
                  iff x0 x1 lie in different quasi-components)))

        (note about syntax design ::
              if (0 X) can be viewed as an individual type,
              so should (1 X) be.
              then it would be not true that
              we can elim level-diff map by product-space.
              maybe we should allow level-diff map,
              and we also should find the rule for its continuity-check.
              [just as what has been done for hott by &apos;tp&apos;]
              just this time, we do not use &apos;tp&apos;,
              but try to re-create &apos;tp&apos;
              by the rule of the continuity-check of product-space.)

        (define example-2
          (lambda (-&gt; I Y)
            (extend-from
              (lambda (-&gt; (0 I) Y)
                (-&gt; i0 y0)
                (-&gt; i1 y1)))
            (note the above is solvable
                  iff y0 y1 lie in a compact, connected and locally connected
                  subspace of Y satisfying the second countability axiom.)))

        (define example-3
          (note about Normal space
                :: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_space">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_space</a>

                this is kind of low-level topology facts
                can not be constructed in my language.))

        (define example-4
          (note about Tietze extension theorem
                :: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tietze_extension_theorem))">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tietze_extension_theorem))</a>

        (note Y is solid-space
              if all of the following problems are solvable
              (lambda (-&gt; X Y)
                (note X is normal space)
                (extend-from
                  (lambda (-&gt; A Y)
                    (note A is closed sub-space))))
              [solid seems no hole])
        #+end_src

***** characteristic-map

      - the type of characteristic-map is
        (-&gt; (boundary (cell n)) (polytopy (sub1 n)))

      - in at1, a dc is a characteristic-map.
        if limited to model characteristic-map,
        dc must always be viewed as unit cell,
        while, ignore this limitation,
        dc might be any orient-able closed space.

***** topology structure

      - the classical approach is to
        set up the topological structure of cellular polytopy [CW complex].
        1. maybe at1 should act at higher level of homotopical structure
           instead of topological structure.
        2. maybe at1 should maintain the ability to handle topological structure.

***** 3 the method of algebraic topology

***** 4 the retraction problem

***** 5 combined maps

      - the way we define a continuous map data-constructor by data-constructor,
        is just like define a combined map.
        [the continuity of the combined map is demonstrated in this section]

***** 6 topological identification

      - quotient-space must be implemented by redefining the equality.
        thus, it seems that product-space and indexed-space,
        all can be reduced to simple-space,
        but quotient-space can not be reduced to simple-space,
        thus is essentially different.

      - in the book, natural-projection is used to depict quotient-space.

      - for the example of quotient-space given by the book,
        &gt; the n-sphere is obtained from the n-cell, by identifying the boundary
        &gt; to a single point, and the real projective n-sphere is obtained from
        &gt; the n-sphere by identifying the antipodal points.

      - but in at1, we can actually define the above spaces,
        without the use of quotient-space.
        and the use of topological identification above,
        is changed to the use of repeated names [like a mark language].

      - but also note that, not all quotient-space can be made simple-space.
        as the other example given in the book,
        where the equality of the space
        is changed by a group of homeomorphisms of the space.
        which is also called orbit-space.

***** 7 the adjunction-space

***** 8 homtopy problem and classification problem

***** 9 the homotopy-extension-property

      - with homotopy-extension-property,
        the extension-problem

        will only dependent on
        the homotopy class of

      - Definition 9.1.
        A subspace A of a space X
        is said to have the homotopy-extension-property (abbreviated HEP)
        in X
        with respect to a space Y,
        if every partial homotopy

      #+begin_src scheme
      (let ([f (lambda (-&gt; X Y)
                 ...)]
            [g (lambda (-&gt; (* A I) Y)
                 (extend-from
                   (lambda (-&gt; (* A (list i0)) Y)
                     (-&gt; (* :a i0)
                         [:a (restrict-on A f) @])))
                 ...)])
        (define h
          (lambda (-&gt; (* X I) Y)
            (extend-from g)
            ...)))
      #+end_src

***** 10 relative homotopy

***** 11 homotopy equivalences

***** 12 the mapping cylinder

***** 13 a generalization of the extension-problem

***** 14 the partial mapping cylinder

***** 15 the deformation problem

***** 16 the lifting problem

***** 17 the most general problem

*** 2 some special cases of the main problems

*** 3 fiber-spaces

***** 1 introduction

      - bundle-spaces has local-product-structure.

      - fiber-space = projection with covering-homotopy-property.
        the axiomatization of homotopy theory need fiber-spaces.

      - path space is fiber-spaces but do not has local-product-structure.
        it has the path lifting property.

      - covering-space = fiber-space with discrete fiber.

***** 2 covering homotopy property

      - (: p (-&gt; E B))
        E is total-space
        B is base-space

      - &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;
        CHP

***** 6 algebraically trivial maps X -&gt; S2

***** 7 liftings and cross-sections

***** 9 mapping spaces

      - the exponential law of mapping spaces
        (-&gt; (* X T) Y) = (-&gt; T (-&gt; X Y))
        [just as currying in programming language]

***** note homotopy group of mapping space

      - a path from a map to a map is a proof of (~ f0 f1)
        of type
        #+begin_src scheme
        (let ([f0 (lambda (-&gt; A B) ...)]
              [f1 (lambda (-&gt; A B) ...)])
          (lambda (-&gt; (* A I) B)
            (extend-from
              (lambda (-&gt; (* A (0 I)) B)
                (-&gt; (* :a i0) [:a f0])
                (-&gt; (* :a i1) [:a f1])))
            ...))
        #+end_src

      - similarly all higher homotopy group can be defined by uncurrying,
        for example,
        the mapping space (-&gt; A (-&gt; I (-&gt; I (-&gt; I B))))
        uncurrying to (-&gt; (* A I I I) B)

***** 10 the spaces of paths

***** 11 the space of loops

      - special mapping space has algebraic structure.
        for example, we have
        - Proposition 11.4.
          if X is an H-space with x0 as a homotopy unit,
          then the fundamental group homotopy(1) (Χ, x0) is abelian.

      - by level-up the space to mapping space
        we can level-down its homotopy group
        for example, we have
        - Proposition 11.6.
          Under the natural multiplication of loop space of point y,
          the path-components of loop space form a group
          which is essentially the fundamental group homotopy(1) (Υ, y).

***** 12 the path lifting property

      - we must express path lifting property in the uncurried way.
        here we apply Bishop&apos;s fourth principle
        &quot;Meaningful distinctions deserve to be maintained.&quot;
        Thus,
        bundle-space and path-space and loop-space etc.
        are not unified, by the covering-homotopy-property,
        to the so called fiber-space.
        [at least practically not so]

      - construct a bundle-space by local-product-structure
        we can specify its higher elements,
        and check its CHP
        [covering-homotopy-property] [homotopy-lifting-property].

        special mapping-space also have CHP,
        which can be checked after uncurrying.

*** 4 homotopy groups

***** 1 introduction

      - homotopy groups of order higher then 1 are abelian.

      - homotopy(0) (Х, x0) and relative-homotopy(1) (Χ, Α, x0)
        are not ordinarily groups.

      - homotopy(1) (Х, x0) and relative-homotopy(2) (Χ, Α, x0)
        are not usually abelian.

      - the excision-property for homology does not hold for homotopy.

***** 2 absolute homotopy groups

      - homotopy(n) (X, x0) = n-loop space of X
        #+begin_src scheme
        (-&gt; n-cell X)
        (restrict-by
          (lambda (-&gt; [...] [...])
           (-&gt; [n-cell boundary] [x0 refl {n-1}])))
        ;; or
        (-&gt; n-sphere X)
        (restrict-by
          (lambda (-&gt; [...] [...])
           (-&gt; [s0] [x0])))
        #+end_src

      - group production of homotopy(n) (X, x0)
        is defined by a map of type
        #+begin_src scheme
        (-&gt; n-cell ((glued at half boundary) n-cell n-cell))
        (restrict-by
          (lambda (-&gt; [...] [...])
           (-&gt; [n-cell boundary] [x0 refl {n-1}])))
        ;; or
        (-&gt; n-sphere ((contact at s0) n-sphere n-sphere))
        (restrict-by
          (lambda (-&gt; [...] [...])
           (-&gt; [s0] [x0])))
        #+end_src

      - homotopy(n) (X, x0), where n &gt; 1, is abelian.
        because there exists a rotation of n-sphere
        interchanges the two hemispheres,
        which leaves s0 fixed.

      - &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;
        but how should I argue the above fact more clearly?

***** 3 relative homotору groups

      - relative-homotopy(n) (X, A, x0)
        where X &gt; A &gt; x0
        defined as follow
        #+begin_src scheme
        (-&gt; n-cell X)
        (restrict-by
          (lambda (-&gt; [...] [...])
           (-&gt; [n-cell boundary] [A]))
          (lambda (-&gt; [...] [...])
           (-&gt; [s0] [x0])))
        #+end_src

      - group production of relative-homotopy(n) (X, A, x0)
        is defined by a map of type
        #+begin_src scheme
        (-&gt; n-cell ((glued at half boundary) n-cell n-cell))
        (restrict-by
          (lambda (-&gt; [...] [...])
           (-&gt; [n-cell boundary] [A]))
          (lambda (-&gt; [...] [...])
           (-&gt; [s0] [x0])))

      - relative-homotopy(n) (X, A, x0), where n &gt; 2, is abelian.
        because there exists a rotation of n-cell
        interchanges the two halves of n-cell,
        which leaves s0 fixed.
