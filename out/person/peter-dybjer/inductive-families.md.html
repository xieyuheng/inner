# 1 Introduction

When extending Martin-Löf&apos;s type theory,
instead of using a general purpose construction which is part of the theory,
we giving external criteria for correct extensions of the theory.

The main point here is that **Martin-Löf&apos;s type theory
is a theory of inductive definitions formulated in natural deduction**.
Each set former (logical constant) is defined inductively by its introduction rules.
The elimination rule expresses a principle of definition by recursion (proof by induction).
Equality rules express how these definitions are eliminated (proofs are normalised).

- **[Xie]** Elimination rule is about how to use a piece of information,
  when the information is introduced inductively, so will the elimination rule.

First we specify what it means to be a correct definition of a set former
by giving formal criteria for the formation and introduction rules.

- **[Xie]** The term &quot;set former&quot; is called &quot;type constructor&quot; by some authors.

Then we show how such a definition determines the elimination and equality rules
by a so called **inversion principle**. We also give an alternative formulation
where recursive definitions are presented schematically.

The scheme is for **monomorphic, intensional type theory**
and covers **strictly positive, iterated, generalised induction**.
This does not cover all forms of intuitionistically meaningful induction,
and thus not all ways of forming sets in Martin-Löf&apos;s type theory.
(An example is the definition of a universe in Tarski&apos;s style.)

# 2 The Theory of Logical Types

The theory is formulated in the style of Martin-Loef&apos;s type theory
with four forms of judgements:

``` js
P type
p : P
p == q : P
P == Q
```

Rules of type formation:

``` js
--------
set type

A : set
--------
A type
```

- **[Xie]**
  The rule above does not make the property that
  `one object only has one type` invalid
  because the judgement `A type` is not `A : type`.

``` js
A type
{ a : A |- T[a] type }
-----------------------
(a : A) -&gt; T[a] type
```

The rules of object formation:

``` js
{ a : A |- p[a] : T[a] }
-----------------------------
(a) =&gt; p[a] : (a : A) -&gt; T[a]

p : (a : A) -&gt; T[a]
q : A
--------------------
p(q) : T[q]
```

- **[Xie]**
  In the paper,
  `(a) =&gt; p[a]` is written as `(a)p[a]`,
  `(a : A) -&gt; T[a]` is written as `(a : A)T[a]`,
  while, I distinguish them by `=&gt;` vs `-&gt;`,
  instead of by the existence of type annotation.

The equality rules are typed beta- and eta-conversion:

``` js
q : A
{ a : A |- p(q) : T[q] }
----------------------------------------
{ (a) =&gt; p(a) } (q) == p(q) : T[q]

p : (a : A) -&gt; T[a]
------------------------------------
p == (a) =&gt; p(a) : (a : A) -&gt; T[a]
```

Moreover, equality is an equivalence relation
and we may everywhere substitute equals for equals:

``` js
// Reflective

A type
---------
A == A

p : A
---------
p == p : A

// Symmetric

A == A1
-------
A1 == A

p == p1 : A
------------
p1 == p : A

// Transitive

A == A1
A1 == A2
--------
A == A2

p == p1 : A
p1 == p2 : A
--------
p == p2 : A

// Substitution in type

p : A
A == A1
-------
p : A1

p == p1 : A
A == A1
--------
p == p1 : A1

// Equivalence formation

A == A1 : set
-------------
A == A1

// Substitution in function type

A == A1
{ a : A |- B[a] == B1[a] }
--------------------------------------
(a : A) -&gt; B[a] == (a : A1) -&gt; B1[a]

// Substitution in expression

p == p1 : (a : A) -&gt; B[a]
q == q1 : A
-----------------------
p(q) == p1(q1) : B[q]
```

A **theory** in the framework sense is specified by
giving a finite sequence of typings of fresh constants `c : A`
and a finite sequence of equalities between terms `p == q : A`.

Formation, introduction, and elimination rules for the set formers
are given by typing fresh constants.
For example, the universe introduction rule above would be given by

``` js
universe_introduction : (a : U) -&gt; (b : (x : T(a)) -&gt; U) -&gt; U
```

# 3 A Scheme for Inductive Definitions

In this section I shall present the scheme for introducing a new set former.
Firstly, there is the general form of formation and introduction rules.
Secondly, there is the inversion principle for deriving
elimination and equality rules from the formation and introduction rules.

## 3.1 Formation Rule

### 3.1.1 Scheme

There is one formation rule (unless we have simultaneous induction, see section 6).
It has the form

- **[Xie]** The notation `(A :: T)` means `(A : T, ...)`.

``` js
P : (A :: T) -&gt; (a :: f[A]) -&gt; set
```

The arguments `A` are called &quot;parameters&quot;,
and the arguments `a` (whoes types might be dependent) are called &quot;indexes&quot;.

### 3.1.2 Examples

``` js
N : set
List : (A : set) -&gt; set
Vec : (A : set) -&gt; (a : N) -&gt; set
```

## 3.2 Introduction Rules

### 3.2.1 Scheme

There are finitely many introduction rules for each set former.
Each introduction rule has the form

``` js
intro : (A :: T) -&gt; (b :: f[A]) -&gt; (u :: g[A, b]) -&gt; P(A)(p[A, b])
```

- **[Xie]** The notion of **s-type** (set-like type) is introduced here,
   An s-type is either a set,
   or a type of functions from an s-type to an s-type.
