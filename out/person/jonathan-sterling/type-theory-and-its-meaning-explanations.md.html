# [Note] Terminology

The &quot;meaning explanation&quot; is called &quot;semantical explanations&quot; in Martin-Löf&apos;s paper
&quot;On the meanings of the logical constants and the justification of logical laws&quot;.

This kind of semantics is almost a description summarize of a particularly implementation,
It is &quot;almost&quot;, because in an implementation one also need to handle error report.
