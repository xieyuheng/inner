# Info

- In this paper,
  Dehn had proved a purely topological result
  which is still known as &quot;Dehn&apos;s Lemma&quot;
  and which implies that the group of a knot is abelian
  and therefore cyclic if and only if the knot is isotopic in threespace with a circle.
  There was a mistake in the proof of the lemma
  which was pointed out in a letter dated April 22, 1929 from H. Kneser to Dehn.
  The lemma, however, is true and was proved by Papakyriakopoulos in 1957, five years after Dehn&apos;s death.
