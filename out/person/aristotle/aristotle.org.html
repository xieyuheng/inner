  - sense : with delight
    experience : many times a sense
    art : cause, general judgement

  - in the world of programming language,
    type is art,
    for it can be used to express general natural of functions.
    [type as theorem]

  - some arts (only some) are useful.
    for example theorems about equality between functions
    can be used to optimize the running of functions in time and space.

  - some useful optimizations are experiences,
    when we can express them by theorems, we have arts.

  - artists can teach, but men of experience can not.
    because the principle cause of the experience
    is written down as theorem and can be told.

  - by designing a programming language,
    I am also crafting a world
    in which experience and art can be explicitly distinguished.

  - but for now I am only designing it mainly by my experiences.
    as a craft man indeed.

  - I think the world of a programming language can be so fun
    if I apply the Metaphysics of Aristotle even more.

  - it is not the knowledge that aristotle arrived,
    but the method he used to travel the world of knowledge, is of great importance.
