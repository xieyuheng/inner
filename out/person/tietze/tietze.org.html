* on the topological invariants of multidimensional manifolds (1908)

*** note

    - some parts of this paper may be read as a clarifying commentary on those by Poincare.

*** intro

    - while we have known, for a long time,
      a set of necessary and sufficient conditions
      for the existence of a one-to-one continuous map
      between two two-dimensional manifolds,
      at present such a system of conditions for three
      and higher dimensional manifolds is not known.

    - it should be remarked that
      the presentation of a manifold as a cell system in Section I,
      is of particular theoretical interest in that
      it permits the construction of analysis situs
      free of the introduction of infinite point sets
      or function theoretic methods.
      This depends on the fact that
      a cell system is determined by
      a finite number of elements
      and a finite number of relations between them.

*** I. The schemata of multidimensional manifolds

***** 1 Demarcation of the point manifolds to be considered

      - a couple of general remarks on the different ways
        of presenting manifolds.
        1. The principal, and simplest, way
           to determine point sets
           and hence all point manifolds
           is to give a collection of points (x1, x2, ..., xn)
           in the space of n rectangular coordinates.
           where each point is represented by a single n-tuple,
           and each n-tuple appearing corresponds to a point of the manifold.
        2. Another way to determine a manifold
           is to view different n-tuples
           as representing the same point of the manifold. [quotient-space]
        3. cell system [viewed as quotient-space]

***** 2 The schemata of two-dimensional manifolds

      - in two-dimensional,
        schema = cell system = system of surface pieces

      - [homeomorphism of schemata]
        elementary subdivisions -&gt;
        successive elementary subdivisions -&gt;
        derived schema -&gt;
        common derived schema -&gt;
        homeomorphism of schemata

      - homeomorphic manifolds
        can never be defined by nonhomeomorphic schemata?

***** 3 The schemata of three-dimensional manifolds

***** 4 Schemata of arbitrary dimension. The meaning of cells and two-sided manifolds

      - a geometric figure must always yield
        a definite arrangement of its boundary elements.

*** II. The Betti numbers

***** 5 Homologies, the Poincaré relation system of a manifold

      - &gt;&lt;

***** 6 Definition of the Betti numbers

***** 7 On the assumptions used in (6)

***** 8 On the topological invariants Pm

*** III. One-sided closed manifolds in a manifold

***** 9 The invariants Qm analogous to the Betti numbers Pm

***** 10 The Poincaré torsion numbers. Determination of Qm

*** IV. The fundamental group

***** 11 The Poincaré numbers of a discrete group

      - One observes immediately that
        two different systems of generators and defining relations
        can define groups that are isomorphic.
        However we have neither solved the general problem
        of theoretically surveying all the possible ways in which
        the same group may be defined, nor found a means for deciding
        in particular cases whether two groups
        given by different systems of generators and defining relations are the same.
