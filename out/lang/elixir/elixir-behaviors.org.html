*** behavior mechanism

    - a module can implement a behavior
      a behavior specify its interface functions
      [just like type-class in haskell]

    - a behavior specification is a special module
      [just like elixir&apos;s struct module]

    - then, in a behavior module,
      we can define generic functions.

      but we have to pass the implementation module
      as an additional argument.

*** GenServer

    - The goal of a GenServer
      is to abstract the &quot;receive&quot; loop.

      Therefore, you should never call your own &quot;receive&quot;
      inside the GenServer callbacks

*** Supervisor

    - Supervisors are used to build a hierarchical process structure
      called a supervision tree.

      Supervision trees provide fault-tolerance
      and encapsulate how our applications start and shutdown.

*** Application

    - an application is a component
      implementing some specific functionality,
      that can be started and stopped as a unit,
      and which can be re-used in other systems.

    - Applications also provide an &quot;application environment&quot;,
      which provides one mechanism
      for configuring long running applications.

*** Phoenix.Channel

    - Channels are based on a simple idea
      -- sending and receiving messages.
      Senders broadcast messages about topics.

    - With Channels, neither senders nor receivers have to be Elixir processes.
      They can be anything that we can teach to communicate over a Channel.
