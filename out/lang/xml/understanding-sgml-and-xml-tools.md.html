# [note]

- this book give a overview of xml tools
  such an overview can be used
  to provide application ideas for programmers

- maybe we can read this book like we are &quot;product manager&quot;s

- user story is indeed important

  - He (the author) provides a guide
    to the labyrinth of SGML and XML tools,
    organized carefully in the way many users need it:
    in terms of the life-cycle of their documents.

    he presents various systems&apos; distinctives:
    what is it that stands out in product X,
    and why might I use it?

    These distinctives often reflect
    the fundamental approach of each system,
    which is much more stable
    than the feature details of a given release.
