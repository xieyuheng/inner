* notation
  * &quot;nature number&quot; is just called &quot;number&quot;
* jo &amp; jojo
  * use &quot;jo&quot; to denote bead
    and use &quot;jojo&quot; to denote a thread of beads
    [which reads like &quot;珠珠&quot; in Chinese]
* naming convention
  * a predicate of a type
    which denotes a subtype of that type
    uses that type as postfix
    such as
    &quot;space-byte?&quot;
  * a function of a type
    uses that type as prefix
    such as
    &quot;string-reverse&quot;
    &quot;string-equal?&quot;
  * side-effect of structured data is postfixed by &quot;!&quot;
* convention in assembly code
  * using underline to compose big word from small words
  * using &quot;$&quot; as prefix and postfix separator
  * indentation level = 3
  * naming convention of jo
    | convention   | jo type  |
    |--------------+----------|
    | prefix &quot;V__&quot; | variable |
  * but I use
    1. &quot;zero&quot; instead of &quot;V__zero&quot;
    2. &quot;true&quot; instead of &quot;V__true&quot;
* convention in cicada-nymph code
  * using dash to compose big word from small words
  * using &quot;,&quot; as prefix and postfix separator
  * indentation style = free
  * words are separated by space
    except for bar-ket
    every bar-ket is viewed as a word
* syntax of cicada-nymph
  * table
    |----------------------+---------------------------|
    | syntax               | semantic                  |
    |----------------------+---------------------------|
    | word borderfix &quot;* *&quot; | variable                  |
    | word borderfix &quot;+ +&quot; | variable                  |
    | word borderfix &quot;: :&quot; | variable                  |
    | word postfix &quot;!&quot;     | some of the side-effect   |
    | word postfix &quot;?&quot;     | predicate                 |
    |----------------------+---------------------------|
    | bar-ket ( )          | not use                   |
    | bar-ket [ ]          | not use                   |
    | bar-ket { }          | not use                   |
    | double-quote         | viewed as special bar-ket |
    |                      | (bar is the same as ket)  |
    |                      | to support string literal |
    |----------------------+---------------------------|
  * but I use
    1. &quot;true&quot; instead of &quot;*true*&quot;
    2. &quot;false&quot; instead of &quot;*false*&quot;
* unique id
  * if one wish to get a named unique id
    a jo maybe used
    for a jo is an address in memory
    it is unique as a memory address
  * but there is not effort made
    to distinguish address and fixnum
    as different type of things
    thus
    this kind of unique id is not fit
    for some tasks
