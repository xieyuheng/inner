* [note]

*** semantic and examples first

    - this time, semantic and examples first.

      we imagine semantic of the language
      than try to express as many examples as possible by new syntax.

*** syntax

    - (n X) for n level element of X
      for example, we have subspace relation (&lt; (= x0 x0) (1 X))

    - (map) for partial-map and total-map

    - (%) as reversed (:)

*** semantic

    - save each other&apos;s pointers as glue.
      this encoding of space,
      helps us to check equivalence by semantic instead of syntax.

    - the type of a function limits how to apply it or compose it.
      the type of a chain limits how to glue it.

    - the type of a chain is its boundary,
      boundary of boundary is empty.

         (: b2 (= a0 a0)))
