* [note]

*** motivation

    - I am reading this because I want to implement cicada
      and the new implementing strategy
      is to use the type system as a logic programming first

    - I have the following understanding :
      - a [typical] dependent type system
        in lack of reification and logic programming interfaces
      - a [typical] logic programming
        in lack of the informations
        about the names of inference rules
        and in lack of the type system

    - minikanren and ukanren are cool
      but they rely on lambda

    - how to do it without lambda?
      will we inevitably re-implement
      all that lambda did for us with no gain
      and make things more complicated than them need to be?

    term-t = + (var-t ...)
    subst-t = dict-t (var-t term-t)
    walk : -- var-t subst-t -- term-t
    deep-walk : -- term-t subst-t -- term-t
    // acting subst-t on term-t
    //   subst-t is compose-able
    /    -- a category -- a preorder
    extend : -- var-t term-t subst-t -- subst-t
    goal-t = -- subst-t -&gt; stream-t (subst-t)
    // but I do not use the above alias
    //   to be clear about the use of lambda
    // note that we have a monad here
    // also note that
    //   if the language is not lazy
    //   to use infinite stream
    //   special lambda tricks are needed
    unify : -- subst-t term-t term-t -&gt; subst-t
    eqo : -- term-t term-t -&gt; -- subst-t -&gt; stream-t (subst-t)
    // and the stream-t returned by eqo
    //   can either has 1 or 0 subst
    //   eqo is the primitive goal constructor

* 1 Introduction

  - the author wish to use
    a gradual presentation of partial Prolog machines
    as shown by the titles of the chapters
    - unification
    - resolution (without backtracking)
    - backtracking

  - this approach is common sense for a good programmer

* 2 Unification - Pure and Simple

*** intro

    - L0 -- lang-0 of term and query

    - M0 -- machine-0 consist of
      - data representation
      - machine instruction

    - having defined a program term p
      one can submit any query?-q
      and execution either
      1. fails if p and q do not unify
      2. or succeeds with a binding of the variables in q
         obtained by unifying it with p

*** 2.1 Term representation

*** 2.2 Compiling L0 queries

    - x -
      a query is not compiled to a term
      but to a sequence of instructions which will build the term

* 3 Flat Resolution - without backtracking

* 4 Prolog

* 5 Optimizing the Design

* A Prolog in a Nutshell

*** terms and substitutions

    - in the most general form, a substitution is

    #+begin_src cicada
    subst-t : -- term-t -&gt; term-t
    #+end_src

    - subst-t is obviously compose-able as function

    - we can see that
      it is indeed good to use function types
      to model our semantics

    - preorder struct of subst-t can be defined by
      - a is more general than b
        if there exist x
        such that a; x = b
      - there `;` is infix notation for function composition
      - note that eqv between functions is used
        to define this relation

    - the relation might be important
      - for defining most general unifier (MGU)
        as result of unification algorithm
      - and if we only want to show
        the most general subst-t to user
        as search results

    - for simple function type like subst-t
      it is easy to see how to struct-lize it
      to dict-t (var-t term-t)
      and use deep-walk as subst-t apply to term-t

    - but for complicated function type like goal-t above
      the solution is not obvious

*** unification algorithm

    - with the abstract definition of subst-t and unify
      we can formalize other semantics of our language
      such as sub-type and type-check more easily

    #+begin_src cicada
    unify : -- u : term-t v : term-t -&gt; s : subst-t
    such-that {
      check-same (term-t) (s (u) s (v))
    }
    #+end_src

    - u and v in `unify` is called equation
      or we can say :

    #+begin_src cicada
    equation-t = * (term-t term-t)
    #+end_src

    - solution preserving translation on equations
      - decomposition
      - variable elimination

    - unification algorithm
      is based on solution preserving translation
      most general unifier (MGU) should be the result

*** [note] unify in searching v.s. unify in checking

    #+begin_src cicada
    // unify in searching
    unify : -- term-t term-t -&gt; subst-t
    // unify in checking
    unify : -- term-t term-t -&gt; result-t (subst-t error-t)
    // because we need to do error report to user
    #+end_src

*** prolog

***** [todo] datatype

      #+begin_src cicada
      relation-t =?

      // in a mexp syntax
      list-append-t:zero (null-c succ succ)
      list-append-t:succ (
        cons-c (car cdr)
        succ
        cons-c (car result-cdr)
      ) {
        list-append-t (cdr succ result-cdr)
      }
      #+end_src

***** interface

      #+begin_src cicada
      query : -- list-t (relation-t) -&gt; stream-t (subst-t)

      query ([
        list-append-t (x y z)
      ])

      relation-t :?

      query : -- relation-t list-t (term-t) -&gt; stream-t (subst-t)

      relation-t = -- list-t (term-t) -&gt; goal-t
      #+end_src

***** low level semantics

      - when try to implement prolog by a machine
        the machinery meens much like that of a parsing machine

      - without backtracking
        during a query
        the car relation-t of list-t (relation-t)
        can be stepped to
        tuple (list-t (relation-t) subst-t)
        where the list-t (relation-t) comes from
        the car relation-t&apos;s choices
        query ([A, B, C]) =&gt; query ([A1, A2, ..., B, C])

      - backtracking is needed
        when choices are made
        - x -
          so called &quot;non-deterministic choices&quot; which means
          choices will make the machine
          a non-deterministic automaton
          where non-deterministic means that the automaton
          does not need to do choices
          (beautiful tautology)

      - two non-deterministic choices are made
        in the process of querying
        1. one of an relation to rewrite
        2. among the potentially many rules
           whose head to unify with this relation

***** problem

      - prolog uses depth first searching
        which we should avoid
