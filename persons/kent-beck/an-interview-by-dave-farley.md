- The things that haven't changed much are the power structures
  around software development, the test driven developments of the world
  and the continuous integrations of the world
  are shadows cast by the power structure,
  and you can not change the shadow without changing the reality.

  There's still so much potential in software development
  that's unrealized and yet it's the human problems
  that we need progress on if we're going to
  make any fundamental lasting change.

- The balance of value that you already have in your head
  versus what you're going to discover changes how valuable it is
  to discover new things.

  My experience showed me that what I don't know is vaster
  and far more valuable than I do know.

  If I organize development around that principle,
  then anything that looks like a easily understood model
  has to be wrong, because that's focused on what I already know.
  
  It's uncomfortable right?
  Because we do not know what we are going to discover.

  - **Xie:** Actually every model has to be wrong,
    Kent said "a easily understood model"
    to exclude some chaos models.
