- The things that haven't changed much are the power structures
  around software development, the test driven developments of the world
  and the continuous integrations of the world
  are shadows cast by the power structure,
  and you can not change the shadow without changing the reality.

  There's still so much potential in software development
  that's unrealized and yet it's the human problems
  that we need progress on if we're going to
  make any fundamental lasting change.
