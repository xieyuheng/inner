# My Motive

[2025-07-29] 想要设计 meta-lisp 因此来学习 LCF。

这篇对 LCF 的介绍来自：
1979-mathematical-foundations-of-computer-science---proceedings。

# 1. Introduction

> ... the idea was not to prove theorems automatically, nor to check
> proofs, but to use a metalanguage of commands to generate proofs
> step by step.  But even though the system possessed features to
> allow many steps to be generated by a single command, and to attack
> goals (intended theorems) by resolving them into subgoals, our
> interest was mainly in the subject matter of the proofs: the
> meanings of programming languages. An example was the proof of
> correctness of a compiling algorithm [13] .

[13] Milner, R. and Weyhrauch, R.W.,
Proving compiler correctness in a mechanized logic,
Machine Intelligence 7, ed. B.Meltzer & D.Michie, Edinburgh University Press,
51-72, 1972.

介绍从 Stanford LCF 到 Edinburgh LCF 的设计变化，
引入变量来取代作为 index 的数字（数学书中常用），
并且把 command 语言变成真正的程序语言。

这种感觉有点类似 chuck moore 介绍，
如何从计算器这种有固定 command 的机器开始，
一直发展到 forth 语言。
