  - he states that Heisenberg discovered quantum mechanics
    by considering the groupoid of transitions for the hydrogen spectrum,
    rather than the usually considered group of symmetry of an individual state.

  - the main examples of groupoids in his book
    are equivalence relations and holonomy goupoids of foliations.
