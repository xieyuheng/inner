# 1 Introduction

> We use the idea of a propagator network as a computational metaphor
> for exploring the consequences of allowing places to accept information
> from multiple sources. We study the design choices available within this
> metaphor and their consequences for the resulting programming system.

# 2 Propagators

> Our computational model is a network of autonomous machines, each
> continuously examining its inputs and producing outputs when possible.
> The inputs and outputs of a machine are shared with other machines so
> that the outputs of one machine can be used as the inputs for another.
> The shared communication mechanism is called a _cell_ and the machines
> that they interconnect are called _propagators_. As a consequence of this
> viewpoint computational mechanisms are naturally seen as wiring diagrams.
