# My Motive

SICM 的目的在于，
利用函数式编程中的严格的符号系统，
来介绍经典力学和微分几何。

我学习 SICM 的动机是学会经典力学，
同时也学习用 Scheme 表达知识的方式。

构拟经典力学的历史：

- 初步地观察，使人们区分出空间与空间中的物体。
- 人们观察到物体在运动，运动的规律被总结为物体之间有相互作用，并称之为力。
- 人们观察到的相同的力对不同物体的作用效果不同，
  人们引入质量这个物体万有的参数来度量这种不同的作用效果。

[2025-02-13] 上面的动机大概是十年前的了。
现在的动机是 simulation，即完成下面的循环：

```scheme
(define (game)
  (loop (input)
        (simulation)
        (render)))
```

# Preface

> Classical mechanics is deceptively simple. It is surprisingly easy

```scheme
(define-class motion-system-t ()
  :configuration-t type-t
  :configuration-path-t (-> time-t @configuration-t))
```

例如 juggling pin：

> The juggling pin rotates as it flies through the air; the
> configuration of the juggling pin is specified by giving the

对于 juggling pin 而言，
configuration = position + orientation。

两个函数如果都是 stationary point，
那么它们的线性组合显然也是 stationary point。

通过我们对运动的直觉，推导出 path-distinguishing function。
能熟练地重复这里的推导过程，就算是学会这一节了。

### Experience of motion

根据我们的日常经验：

- 构型路径应该是连续且光滑的函数。

- 物理系统的运动不依赖于系统的历史。

- 物理系统的运动是确定性的，
  即只要知道了系统的当前状态（通常只是几个参数），
  系统的未来演化方式就是完全确定的。

### Realizable paths

对于可实现的构型路径，我们也有一些直觉上的要求：

- 如果一个路径是可实现的，
  那么这个路径的任意一个片段（segment）都是可实现的；
  反之如果一个路径被分成了很多片段，
  并且每个片段都是可实现的，
  那么这整个路径就是可实现的。

- 一个路径片段可实现与否，依赖于其上的每一个点。
  并且依赖于每一个点的方式都是一样的，
  每个点都是平等的，没有特殊的点。

- 一个路径片段可实现与否，只依赖于这个片段内的点。
  即路径片段的可实现性是一个局部属性。

因此所要找的路径区分函数，
是每一个瞬间的路径片段上的，
某种局部属性的聚合。

一种满足件的聚合方式是加法，
此时路径区分函数是就某个路径的局部属性而言，
在路径片段上的积分。

这里的注释是：

> We suspect that this argument can be promoted to a precise
> constraint on the possible ways of making this path-distinguishing
> function.

也许确实如此，可以模仿 William Lawvere 在证明 Brouwer 定理时，
原地构造了一个 category 的方式，来处理这里的推理。

> So we will try to arrange that the path-distinguishing function,
> constructed as an integral of a local property along the path,

```
action := path-distinguishing function
```

> Let `γ` be the configuration-path function;

```scheme
(claim configuration-t type-t)
(define configuration-path-t (-> time-t configuration-t))
(claim γ (-> time-t configuration-t))
(claim γ configuration-path-t)
```

> `γ(t)` is the configuration at time `t`.

```scheme
(claim t time-t)
(claim (γ t) configuration-t)
```

> The action of the segment of the path `γ`
> in the time interval from `t1` to `t2` is:

```scheme
(claim t1 time-t)
(claim t2 time-t)
(claim definite-integral
  (-> (-> time-t real-t) time-t time-t real-t))
(claim F
  (-> configuration-path-t time-t real-t))
(define (S γ t1 t2)
  (definite-integral (F γ) t1 t2))
```

> where `F[γ]` is a function of time that measures some local
> property of the path. It may depend upon the value of the function
> `γ` at that time and the value of any derivatives of `γ` at that
> time.

> Traditionally, square brackets are put around functional arguments.
> In this case, the square brackets remind us that the value of `S`
> may depend on the function `γ` in complicated ways, such as
> through its derivatives.

## 1.2 Configuration Spaces

状态空间
状态空间的维度
状态轨迹 状态路径

## 1.3 Generalized Coordinates

In order to be able to talk about specific configurations
we need to have a set of parameters
that label the configurations.

Xie:
这种对座标系的直觉理解
也指明了推广座标系这个概念的方向

Xie:
上面这句话也可以拆解成如下
- In order to be able to talk about something
  we need to have name them.
- In order to be able to talk about specific configurations
  we need to label the configurations.
- we use a set of numerical parameters
  to label the configurations.

Xie:
这里很多篇幅是用来作 座标系无关 讨论的
我想如果加入一个限制的话会更好
比如 限制流形 为 代数方程的零点
