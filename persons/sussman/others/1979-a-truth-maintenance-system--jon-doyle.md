# ABSTRACT

> To choose their actions, reasoning programs must be able to make
> assumptions and subsequently revise their beliefs when discoveries
> contradict these assumptions. The Truth Maintenance System (TMS) is
> a problem solver subsystem for performing these functions by
> recording and maintaining the reasons for program beliefs.
> Such recorded reasons are useful in constructing explanations of
> program actions and in guiding the course of action of a problem
> solver.
