# Abstract

We demonstrate how to view a type system as a homomorphism between two monoids,
where the space of types is monoid, the space of terms is also a monoid,
and the homomorphism is the `infer` function of the type system.

We use a concrete example to demonstrate this idea,
in our example the space of types is a space of _linear logic propositions_,
and the space of terms is a space of _concatenative programs_.

The space of concatenative programs is inspired by
the Forth programming language
and the Joy programming language.

Some key points of our demonstration:

- Negation of linear logic should NOT be interpreted as "implying false",
  but be interpreted as a type of _linear assignment_ (thus non classical).

- Linear logic additive connectives can be interpreted without concurrency.

- Type errors will be captured by a special `Error` element.

# Introduction

Firstly, a homomorphism between two monoids can be viewed as a type system.
We can view this homomorphism as the `infer` function,
given a term it can infer the type of this term.

I say "type system", because I think
the principle of type theory is

> To study **terms** and **types** together.

and a homomorphism allow us to study the two monoids together.

The reverse is also true, given a type system,
we can construct two monoids to be the space of terms and types.
And we can interpret concepts in type system as equations in monoid.

- The reverse is NOT true, given a type system,
  only when the terms of the type system
  is designed to be Church style (every term can be inferred)
  instead of Curry style, can we view it to be
  a homomorphism between monoids.

  When the terms are in Curry style,
  beside `infer`, we also need `check`.

# Example: A syntax for the terms of linear logic

Let's define two concrete monoids and a homomorphism between them,
to see the idea of this paper in action.

We call the homomorphism `infer`,
it's domain is the space of **terms**,
it's codomain is the space of **types**.

The types will be _linear logic propositions_.

The terms will be _concatenative programs_.

We use whitespace as infix notation
to denote the binary operation
of the monoids (instead of using an explicit infix notation like `â€¢`).

If `x` and `y` are elements, so is `x y`.

We use `<infer> ... </infer>` to apply the `infer` homomorphism
to an element of the term monoid.

Since `infer` is a homomorphism, we have:

```
<infer> x y </infer> = <infer> x </infer> <infer> y </infer>
```

## The plan

Our plan is to take two free monoids of symbols as base monoids to start with.

Then we define ways to construct new elements in these two monoids,
meanwhile refine the definition of `infer` for these new elements.

And we refine the base monoids to be not just any symbols,
but symbols introduced by datatype definitions.

## Two free monoids of symbols and a trivial homomorphism

A element of **the monoid of terms** is a list of symbols,
chosen from the first four lower case latin alphabets -- `a, b, c, d`,
such as:

- `a`
- `a b`
- `a b b a`
- `a c d c`

A element of **the monoid of types** is a list of symbols,
chosen from the first four upper case latin alphabets -- `A, B, C, D`,
such as:

- `A`
- `A B`
- `A B B A`
- `A C D C`

The empty list is the **identity element** of both monoids,
for convenience we also explicitly write them as `empty` and `Empty` in equations.

And we define the `infer` to be the trivial homomorphism
from lower case words to capitalized words,
for examples:

```
<infer> a </infer> = A

<infer> a b </infer> = <infer> a </infer> <infer> b </infer> = A B

<infer> empty </infer> = Empty
```

## Abstraction of both term and type

If `x` is a term, so is `[ x ]`.

If `X` is a type, so is `[ X ]`.

- We call this way of constructing new elements **abstraction**.

We refine the definition of `infer` for abstraction:

```
<infer> [ x ] </infer> = [ <infer> x </infer> ]
```

In the monoid of terms, we introduce a postfix operator `apply`
to denote application of abstraction.

We then introduce the following equivalent relation
for elements constructed by abstraction.

**Abstraction of term can be applied:**

```
[ x ] apply = x
```

## Linear assignment of term, and negation of type

If `X` is a type, `$$x X ... x ...` is a term.

- We call this way of constructing new terms **linear assignment**,
  it is linear in the sense that an assigned variable
  must be referenced once and only once.

If `X` is a type, `X neg` is also a type.

- We call this way of constructing new types **negation**.

  Note that this is NOT `X`'s inverse element in the monoid,
  but only a _postfix notation_ to construct new element
  (If we really can get the inverse element of any element,
  we will be working within group instead of monoid).

We refine the definition of `infer` for linear assignment and negation:

```
<infer> X $$x ... x ... </infer> =
X neg <infer> ... </infer> X <infer> ... </infer>
```

i.e. negation is the type of linear assignment.

For example:

```
<infer> A $$x b x c </infer> = A neg B A C
```

We then introduce the following equivalent relation
for elements constructed by linear assignment and negation.

**Linear assignment can take the left term and substitute it into the place of reference:**

```
y X $$x ... x ... = ... y ...
```

**Negation cancels an type from the right side:**

```
X X neg = Empty
```

**Negation is involutive:**

```
X neg neg = X
```

We introduce a syntactic shorthand for writing negation in `[ ... ]`,

```
[ X -- Y ]
```

is the same as

```
[ X neg Y ]
```

For example:

```
<infer> [ A $$x b x c ] </infer> = [ A -- B A C ]
```

## Datatype definition

At the beginning, we took the free monoid of symbols as our base monoids,
we did this only to introduce new concepts step by step.
Now it is time to refine these base monoids.

We used to use `a, b, c, d` as generaters of the monoid of terms,
and `A, B, C, D` as generaters of the monoid of types,
we abandon them from now on.

And we switch to a system where
only symbols defined by `datatype` keyword
are generaters of our monoids.

An exmaple of datatype definition is the following:

```
datatype Nat
  case zero -- Nat end
  case add1 Nat -- Nat end
end
```

After this definition:

- `Nat` is a type.
- `zero` is a term.
- `add1` is a term.

We say `Nat` is a **type constructor**,
and `zero` and `add1` are two **data constructors**.

The datatype definition also defines the homomorphism for between elements:

```
<infer> zero </infer> = Nat
<infer> add1 </infer> = Nat neg Nat
```

## Global variable definition

We can use the `claim` keyword to claim a global variable's type
and the `define` keyword to define a global variable's term.

- A variable introduced by linear assignment is called "local variable" (or "bound variable"),
  and a global variable (or say free variable) is different from them.

```
claim one Nat end
define one zero add1 end

claim two Nat end
define two one add1 end
```

We infer the type of defined term,
to check whether the inferred type is equal to the claimed type.

Our definition of `one` passes this type check.

```
<infer> one </infer> =

<infer> zero add1 </infer> =

<infer> zero </infer> <infer> add1 </infer> =

Nat Nat neg Nat =

Nat
```

Our definition of `two` also passes this type check.

```
<infer> two </infer> =

<infer> one add1 </infer> =

<infer> zero add1 add1 </infer> =

<infer> zero </infer>
<infer> add1 </infer>
<infer> add1 </infer> =

Nat Nat neg Nat Nat neg Nat =

Nat
```

## Matching of term

We can use `match` to construct a term against a given datatype.

```
<type> match
  case <data-constructor> ... end
  case <data-constructor> ... end
  ...
end
```

We must also define `infer` for `match`:

```
<infer> <type> match
  case <data-constructor> ... end
  case <data-constructor> ... end
  ...
end
</infer> = <type> neg unify_types(
  return_type_of(<data-constructor>) <infer> ... </infer>,
  return_type_of(<data-constructor>) <infer> ... </infer>,
  ...,
)
```

Suppose we define `unify_types` as function
which unifies all its arguments with each other, and return the unified type.

If the unification failed, it will return a special element in the monoid of types -- `Error`.

- Complete definition of the unification will explained in the following sections.

The equivalent relation for `Error` is

```
X Error = Error
Error X = Error
```

We then introduce the following equivalent relation
for elements constructed by `match`.

```
x <type> match end
  case <data-constructor> ... end
  case <data-constructor> ... end
  ...
end = assert_types(<infer> x </infer>, <type>) match_data(x, ..., ..., ...)
```

We define `assert_types` as a function the same as `unify_types` by return `Empty`.

And we define `match_data` as a function

- If its first term is NOT end with one of the given data constructors,
  it returns `error`;
- If its first term ends with one of the given data constructors,
  it remove the ending data constructor
  and compose the remaining term with the term in the matching clause.

the equivalent relation for `error` is

```
x error = error
error x = error
```

We can use `match` to define addition for `Nat`.

```
claim add Nat Nat -- Nat end
define add
  Nat match
    case zero end
    case add1 add add1 end
  end
end
```

Type check:

```
<infer>
  Nat match
    case zero end
    case add1 add add1 end
  end
</infer> =

Nat neg unify_types(<infer> empty </infer>, Nat <infer> add add1 </infer>) =
Nat neg unify_types(Empty, Nat <infer> Nat neg Nat neg Nat Nat neg Nat </infer>) =
Nat neg unify_types(Empty, Nat Nat neg Nat neg Nat Nat neg Nat) =
Nat neg unify_types(Empty, Nat neg Nat) =
Nat neg Nat neg Nat
```

In the example above we see `unify_types(Empty, Nat neg Nat) = Nat neg Nat`.

Example computation of `add`:

```
one one add =
one zero add1 Nat match
  case zero end
  case add1 add add1 end
end = one zero add add1
```

In the above step, we see `one zero add1` ends with `add1`,
thus the second clause is a match,
we remove the ending `add1`,
and compose the remaining `one zero`
with the term in the match clause -- `add add1`.

```
one zero add add1 =
one zero Nat match
  case zero end
  case add1 add add1 end
end add1 = one add1
```

In the above step, we see `one zero` ends with `zero`,
thus the first clause is a match,
we remove the ending `zero`,
and compose the remaining `one`
with the term in the match clause -- `empty`.

We can also view the above definition of `add` by `match`,
as adding a new term (`add`) to the monoid of terms,
and adding the following two equations:

```
zero add = empty;
add1 add = add add1;
```

If we infer the left hand side and the right hand side
of the first equation, we will see the resulting types
unify with each other.

```
<infer> zero add </infer> =

Nat Nat neg Nat neg Nat =

Nat neg Nat
```

```
<infer> empty </infer> =

Empty
```

The same is true for the second equation.

```
<infer> add1 add </infer> =

Nat neg Nat Nat neg Nat neg Nat =

Nat neg Nat neg Nat
```

```
<infer> add add1 </infer> =

Nat neg Nat neg Nat Nat neg Nat =

Nat neg Nat neg Nat
```

Thus `match` can be viewed as a special way of adding new term to the monoid of terms,
and together with the equations the new term must satisfies.
