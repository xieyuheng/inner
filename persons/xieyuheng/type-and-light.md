# Abstract

write something about category semantics
and algebraic semantics in general
compare models of light

# Introduction

To develop the theory of light,
first we make observation about what light does,
then we make a model to explain what light is.

The use of a model is to explain.

As more observations are done, we change the model
to improve the explanation.
