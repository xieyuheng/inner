# Part I General Background

## Chapter 1 Genesis

> Just what is Mathematical Logic?
> More generally, what is Logic,
> whether mathematical or not?

> Many people have asked me what mathematical logic is, and what its
> purpose is. Unfortunately, no simple definition can give one the
> remotest idea of what the subject is all about. Only after going
> into the subject will its nature become apparent. As to purpose,
> there are many purposes, but again, one can understand them only
> after some study of the subject. However, there is one purpose that
> I can tell you right now, and that is to make precise the notion of
> a proof.

> It is important to understand the difference between a syllogism
> being valid and a syllogism being sound. A valid syllogism is one in
> which the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises,
> regardless of whether the premises are true or not. A sound
> syllogism is a syllogism which is not only valid, but in which, in
> addition, the premises are true.

> I am amused by syllogisms that appear to be obviously invalid,
> but are actually valid!

哈哈。

提到了布尔在 "An Investigation of the Laws of Thought" 中，
尝试分析斯宾诺莎的推理的有效性，而不在乎合理性。
感觉布尔这本书也值得看看，因为我也喜欢斯宾诺莎。
