Any "presentation" of a concept of algebraic structure
(e.g., groups, modules over a given ring, Jordan algebras, lattices, etc.),
which involves a set of symbols denoting finitary operations
together with a set of equations (= identities) relating composite operations,
determines an algebraic theory, and conversely every algebraic theory has such presentations.

By a mapping between algebraic theories we will understand a functor
which preserves products and takes `1` into `1`.

Algebraic theories and the mappings between them thus form a category.

- Xie: Not category of all groups, but category of all algebraic theories.
