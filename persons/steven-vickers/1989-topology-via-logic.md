# My Motive

[2025-06-28] Scott 的 domain theory 的基础是 topology，
而 Milner 认为，在研究 formal system 时，
domain theory 和指称语义是核心重要的，
因为模型可以给看似任意的 formal system 设计以指导。

# Preface

> Both [this book's] subject matter and its approach derive from a
> particular view of topology that has arisen in theoretical computer
> science.

> ... the story starts with the theory of _domains_, as founded by
> Scott and Strachey [71] to provide a mathematical foundation for
> the semantics of programming languages.

> As well as defining domains, Scott also showed that they could be
> put into a topological setting, and Mike Smyth [83] has developed
> the idea that this is not merely a technical trick. The topology
> captures an essential computational notion, under the slogan "open
> sets are semidecidable properties". This emphasis gives the open
> sets a life independent of the points of the topological space, and
> this led Smyth to make connections with an unexpected strand of
> mathematics, _locale_ theory.

> Modem applications of topology, many of them in algebraic geometry,
> have given point to two ideas.
>
> - First, interesting topological spaces need not satisfy the
>   Hausdorff separation axiom. This is well bom out in domains, whose
>   rich specialization ordering is entirely alien to Hausdorff
>   separation.
>
> - Second, it is often worth thinking of the open sets as forming an
>   algebraic structure -- _a frame_ -- in its own right. To a large
>   extent one can then ignore the points, and do _pointless_ or
>   _localic_ topology. Locale theory is well described in Johnstone's
>   excellent book [82].
