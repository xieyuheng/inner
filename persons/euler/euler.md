# Questions

How does Euler understand chain rule?

How does Euler understand infinitesimal?

How does Euler understand e'(x) = e(x)?

By the arithmetization of analysis
implicit differentiation is hard to explain,
because we can not use dx and dy directly.
How does Euler use infinitesimal directly?

Since Euler does not have the arithmetization of calculus,
he must view all the concepts of calculus with good intuition!
