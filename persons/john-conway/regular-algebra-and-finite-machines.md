# 0. Preliminaries to the Moore Theory

for Kleene's algebraic theory of machines.
we begin by formalizing the notionof machine.
and present Moore's identification theory of machines.

finite machine [sequential machine] [Moore machine] [finite automaton]

- machine
  machine .states
  machine .inputs
  machine .outputs
  initial-state
  (: :input (-> state -- state))
  (: observe (-> state -- output))

given a machine, observe it by input and output,
[to get a specification]
and construct a minimal machine,
which has the same behavior as the original machine.
