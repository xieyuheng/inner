# Abstract

> from the formation and introduction rules for a type in Martin-Löf's
> theory of types. The construction is based on an understanding of the
> inference rules in the theory as judgements in a pre-theory. The
> motivation for the construction is to permit disciplined extensions to
> the theory as well as to have a deeper understanding of its structure.
