# Abstract

A class of models intended to be as minimal and structureless as
possible is introduced. The models can be viewed as describing
networks, relations, sets, or a variety of other structures. Even in
cases with simple rules, highly complex behavior can emerge, some of
which has striking similarities to known core features of fundamental
physics.
