# Reader's Advisory
The style of exposition in this book is somewhat experimental.

The most efficient logical order for a subject is usually different
from the best psychological order in which to learn it. Much
mathematical writing is based too closely on the logical order of
deduction in a subject, with too many definitions before, or without,
the examples which motivate them, and too many answers before, or
without, the questions they address. In a formal and logically ordered
approach to a subject, readers have little choice but to follow along
passively behind the author: in the faith that machinery being
developed will eventually be used to manufacture something worth the
effort.
