# Reader's Advisory

The style of exposition in this book is somewhat experimental.

The most efficient logical order for a subject is usually different
from the best psychological order in which to learn it. Much
mathematical writing is based too closely on the logical order of
deduction in a subject, with too many definitions before, or without,
the examples which motivate them, and too many answers before, or
without, the questions they address. In a formal and logically ordered
approach to a subject, readers have little choice but to follow along
passively behind the author: in the faith that machinery being
developed will eventually be used to manufacture something worth the
effort.

Mathematics is a huge and highly interconnected structure. It is not
linear. As one reads mathematics, one needs to have an active mind,
asking questions, forming mental connections between the current topic
and other ideas from other contexts, so as to develop a sense of the
structure not just familiarity with a particular tour through the
structure.

The style of exposition in this book is intended to encourage the
reader to pause, to look around and to explore. I hope you will take
the time to construct your own mental images, to form connections
with other areas of mathematics and intcrconnections withiu the
subject itself.

Think of a tinkertoy set. The key is the pieces which have holes.
allowing you to join them with rods to form interesting and highly
interconnected structures. No intcresting mathematical topic is
self-contained or complete: rather, it is full of "holes," or natural
questions and ideas not readily answe.red by techniques native to the
topic. These holes often give rise to commotions between the given
topic and other topics that seem at first unrelated. Mathematical
exposition often conceals these holes, for the sake of smoothness, but
what good is a tinkertoy set if the holes are all filled in with
modeling clay?
