# Abstract

>  This paper describes a course in compiler design that focuses on
>  the Scheme implementation of a Scheme compiler that generates
>  native assembly code for a real architecture. The course is
>  suitable for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate
>  students. It is intended both to provide a general knowledge about
>  compiler design and implementation and to serve as a springboard to
>  more advanced courses. Although this paper concentrates on the
>  implementation of a compiler, an outline for an advanced topics
>  course that builds upon the compiler is also presented.
