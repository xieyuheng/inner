# Abstract

> Chez Scheme is now over 20 years old, the first version having been
> released in 1985. This paper takes a brief look back on the history
> of Chez Scheme’s development to explore how and why it became the
> system it is today.

# 1 Introduction

> Our primary objectives remain reliability and efficiency. A reliable
> system is one that correctly implements the entire language and
> never crashes due to a fault in the compiler or run-time
> environment. An efficient system is one that exhibits uniformly good
> performance in all aspects of its operation, with a fast compiler
> that generates fast code and does so for the widest variety of
> programs and programming styles possible.
