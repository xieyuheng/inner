<cloze>
  Fonts meant for headlines usually have <blank>tighter</blank>
  letter-spacing and <blank>shorter</blank> lowercase letters
  (a shorter x-height), while fonts meant for smaller sizes have
  <blank>wider</blank> letter-spacing and <blank>taller</blank>
  lowercase letters.
</cloze>

<cloze>
  For the best reading experience,
  make your paragraphs wide enough
  to fit between <blank>45</blank>
  and <blank>75</blank> characters per line.
</cloze>

<cloze>
  Align mixed font sizes by their <blank>baseline</blank>,
  which is the imaginary line that letters rest on.
</cloze>

<question>
  What is the use of line-height?

  <answer>
    The reason we add space between lines of text
    is to make it easy for the reader to find the next line
    when the text wraps.
  </answer>
</question>

<cloze>
  When text is small, <blank>extra line spacing</blank> is important
  for making it easier to find the next line when the text wraps.
</cloze>

<cloze>
  Line-height and font size are <blank>inversely proportional</blank>
  -- use a <blank>taller</blank> line-height for small text
  and a <blank>shorter</blank> line-height for large text.
</cloze>

<question>
  When we should use color for links?

  When we should NOT use color for links?

  <answer>
    When including a link in a block of non-link text,
    it's important to make sure that
    the link stands out and looks clickable.

    But when designing an interface where almost everything is a link,
    using a treatment designed to make links “pop” in paragraph text
    can be really overbearing.
  </answer>
</question>

<question>
  Why long text should NOT be center-aligned?

  <answer>
    Because text should be aligned to match
    the direction of the language it’s written in.

    Center-alignment only works for headlines
    or short, independent blocks of text.
  </answer>
</question>

<cloze>
  If you’ve got a few blocks of text you want to center
  but one of them is a bit too long, the easiest fix is to
  <blank>rewrite the content and make it shorter</blank>.
</cloze>

<cloze>
  Numbers in table should be <blank>right-aligned</blank>,
  so that it is a lot easier to compare them at a glance.
</cloze>

<cloze>
  One can use <blank>hyphens: auto;</blank>
  to mimic a print look, like books and articles.
</cloze>

<cloze>
  When styling text, we can tweak the weight, color, line-height
  and <blank>letter-spacing</blank>.
</cloze>

<cloze>
  When font is designed for main content text,
  but you want to use it for headlines,
  it can often make sense to <blank>decrease the letter-spacing</blank>.
</cloze>

<cloze>
  All-caps text does not have as much as visual variety
  as normal "sentence case" text.

  For this reason, it often makes sense
  to <blank>increase the letter-spacing</blank>
  of all-caps text to improve readability.
</cloze>

<back-cover>
  - Establish a type scale

  - Use good fonts

  - Keep your line length in check

  - Baseline, not center

  - Line-height is proportional

  - Not every link needs a color

  - Align with readability in mind

  - Use letter-spacing effectively
