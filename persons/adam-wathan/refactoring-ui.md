# Starting from Scratch

- Start with a feature, not a layout

- Detail comes later

- Donâ€™t design too much

<mimor src="refactoring-ui/01-starting-from-scratch.mimor" />

- Choose a personality

<mimor src="refactoring-ui/01.4-choose-a-personality.mimor" />

- Limit your choices

<mimor src="refactoring-ui/01.5-limit-your-choices.mimor" />

# Hierarchy is Everything

- Not all elements are equal

- Size isn't everything

- Don't use grey text on colored backgrounds

- Emphasize by de-emphasizing

- Labels are a last resort

- Separate visual hierarchy from document hierarchy

- Balance weight and contrast

- Semantics are secondary

<mimor src="refactoring-ui/02-hierarchy-is-everything.mimor" />

# Layout and Spacing

- Start with too much white space

- Establish a spacing and sizing system

- You don't have to fill the whole screen

- Grids are overrated

- Relative sizing doesn't scale

- Avoid ambiguous spacing

<mimor src="refactoring-ui/03-layout-and-spacing.mimor" />

# Designing Text

- Establish a type scale

- Use good fonts

- Keep your line length in check

- Baseline, not center

- Line-height is proportional

- Not every link needs a color

- Align with readability in mind

- Use letter-spacing effectively

<mimor src="refactoring-ui/04-designing-text.mimor" />

# Working with Color

- Ditch hex for HSL

- You need more colors than you think

- Define your shades up front

- Don't let lightness kill your saturation

- Greys don't have to be grey

- Accessible doesn't have to mean ugly

- Don't rely on color alone

# Creating Depth

- Emulate a light source

- Use shadows to convey elevation

- Shadows can have two parts

- Even flat designs can have depth

- Overlap elements to create layers

# Working with Images

- Use good photos

- Text needs consistent contrast

- Everything has an intended size

- Beware user-uploaded content

# Finishing Touches

- Supercharge the defaults

- Add color with accent borders

- Decorate your backgrounds

- Don't overlook empty states

- Use fewer borders

- Think outside the box
