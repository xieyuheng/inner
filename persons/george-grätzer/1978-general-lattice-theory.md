# My Motive

[2025-07-11] 在实现带有 structural type system 的 lisp -- x-lisp 时，
我想用 lattice theory 来理解 type system，
把整个 type system 当成是一个 lattice，
把每个 type 当成是其中的一个元素。

类型所构成的 lattice 应该用展示论（presentation theory）来研究：

- lattice 运算 join 和 meet 对应于类型（集合）的 union 与 join。

- 属于某个类型的元素的集合，
  就构成了 lattice 的表示论（representation theory），
  即用集合的 lattice 表示一般的 lattice。

- 类型构造子对应于 presentation 的 generators，
  或者应该称为 generator constructors，
  因为一个类型构造子可以构造任意多的 generators。
  就像把 combinatory logic 视为为 magma 代数时的 SKI。

- 类型构造子之间的关系对应于 presentation 的 relations 方程。
  比如 record type，tuple type 和 function type，
  在 union 和 inter 下所形成的关系。

因此想通过这本书对 lattice theory 有一个更一般的了解。

# My Notes

## type system as lattice

[2025-07-11]

目前的想法：

- tuple -- 某种 direct product。
- record -- 用基础元素的 meet，表示所有 record，同时也是某种 direct product。
- tau -- tuple 和 record 的某种 direct product。

为了给已有的 lattice 引入新的 constructor，
是否只需要定义这个 constructor
和所有其他 constructors 之间的可能的 relations？

# Introduction

> The goal of the present volume can be stated very simply: to discuss
> in depth the basics of general lattice theory. In other words, I
> tried to include what I consider the most important results and
> research methods of all of lattice theory. To treat the rudimentary
> results in depth and still keep the size of the volume from getting
> out of hand, I had to omit a great deal.

> ... It is hoped that even those whose main interest lies in areas not
> treated here in detail will find this volume useful by obtaining
> from this book the background in lattice theory so necessary in
> allied fields.

> In my view, distributive lattices have played a many faceted role in
> the development of lattice theory. Historically, lattice theory
> started with (Boolean) distributive lattices; as a result, the
> theory of distributive lattices is one of the most extensive and
> most satisfying chapters of lattice theory. Distributive lattices
> have provided the motivation for many results in general lattice
> theory. Many conditions on lattices and on elements and ideals of
> lattices are weakened forms of distributivity. Therefore, a thorough
> knowledge of distributive lattices is indispensable for work in
> lattice theory. Finally, in many applications the condition of
> distributivity is imposed on lattices arising in various areas of
> mathematics, especially algebra.

> This viewpoint moved me to break with the traditional approach to
> lattice theory, which proceeds from partially ordered sets to
> general lattices, semimodular lattices, modular lattices, and,
> finally, to distributive lattices. That is why distributive lattices
> are treated as a first priority in this book. This approach has the
> added advantage that the reader (or the student in the classroom)
> reaches interesting and deep results early in the book.

> Chapter I gives a concise development of the basic concepts of
> lattice theory.  Diagrams are emphasized because I believe that a n
> important part of learning lattice theory is the acquisition of
> skill in drawing diagrams. This point of view is stressed throughout
> the book by about 130 diagrams (heeding Alice’s advice: “and what
> is the use of it book without pictures or conversations”,
> L. Carroll [1865]); the reader would be well advised to draw many
> times more while reading the book. A special feature of this chapter
> is a detailed development of free lattices generated by a partial
> lattice over an arbitrary equational class; this is one of the most
> important research tools of lattice theory.

第一章就处理了我所需要的展示论。

> Chapter II develops distributive lattices including representation
> theorems, congruences, congruence lattices of general lattices,
> Boolean algebras, and topological representations. The last section
> is a brief introduction to the theory of distributive lattices with
> pseudocomplementation. While the theory of distributive lattices is
> developed in detail, the reader should keep in mind that the purpose
> of this chapter is, basically, to serve as a model for the rest of
> lattice theory.

> In Chapter III we discuss congruences and ideals of general
> lattices. The various types of ideals discussed all imitate to some
> extent the behaviour of ideals in distributive lattices.

> After giving the basic facts concerning modular and semimodular
> lattices, Chapter IV investigates in detail the connection between
> lattice theory and geometry. We develop the theory of geometric
> lattices, in particular direct decompositions and geometric lattices
> arising out of geometries and graphs. As an important example, we
> investigate partition lattices. The last section deals with
> complemented modular lattices and projective geometries.

> Chapters V and VI deal with two new areas of investigation.
> Equational classes of lattices is one of the most promising new
> fields. In Chapter V most of the basic facts are presented along
> with some more specialized methods. Chapter VI grew out of an
> investigation of free lattices. It intends to prove that almost all
> the results on free lattices can he obtained within the framework of
> free products of lattices. In addition, free products can be used to
> construct interesting examples of lattices.
