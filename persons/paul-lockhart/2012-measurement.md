# 学习目的

看了《一位数学家的挽歌》之后想进一步看看，
Paul 会如何展示数学的艺术。

# Reality and Imagination

> surprising things that keep me amused and entertained. It’s an

首先是 physical reality v.s. mathematical reality。

> The thing is, physical reality is a disaster. It’s way too
> complicated, and nothing is at all what it appears to be. Objects
> expand and contract with temperature, atoms fly on and off.  In
> particular, nothing can truly be measured. A blade of grass has no

> a rough approximation. It’s not bad; it’s just the nature of the
> place. The smallest speck is not a point, and the thinnest wire is
> not a line.

> Mathematical reality, on the other hand, is imaginary. It can be as
> simple and pretty as I want it to be. I get to have all those
> perfect things I can’t have in real life. I will never hold a
> circle in my hand, but I can hold one in my mind. And I can measure

> with my friends.

> The former is important to me because I am in it,
> the latter because it is in me.

比如在 Coxeter 关于多面体的书中，
开始就是列举多面体，然后做度量。
希望从这本书中，我能学会欣赏各种数学结构的方式。

计算机科学和编程的意义就在于，
在欣赏数学结构的同时，
我们还能用程序去模拟。

# On Problems

第一次听到这种说法，
提出数学问题本身也是一个艺术。
对于我所关心的数学问题

> So what exactly is the mystery here? The mystery is why.
> Why would a triangle want to do such a thing?
> ... What we are looking for is an explanation.

> Now here’s where the art comes in. In order to explain we have to
> create something. Namely, we need to somehow construct an argument
> -- a piece of reasoning that will satisfy our curiosity as to why
> this behavior is happening.

"The Book of Why" again!

> How will we ever know anything about a purely imaginary realm? The
> point is, it doesn’t matter so much what is true. It matters why
> it’s true.  The why is the what.

> We have discovered what we think may be a beautiful truth, and now
> we need to prove it. This is what mathematicians do, and this is
> what I hope you will enjoy doing yourself.

"A proof explains why"!
这与 "The Book of Why" 中的
"a model explains why" 有什么关系？
如果 logic 只是观察，
那么在数学证明中，
为什么 logic 可以给出关于 why 的最让人满意的解释？
也许在这里，logic 只是工具，
实际上对 why 给出满意解释的还是 model。

> There is no systematic way to create beautiful and meaningful
> paintings or sculptures, and there is also no method for producing
> beautiful and meaningful mathematical arguments.

这前一句话已经被生成式 AI 反驳了，
AI 应该也可以用来生成证明，
不是简单的生成，而是搜索，
因为机器本身就可以验证所搜索到的证明是否正确。

给定 Type 去找证明的搜索，
简单的逻辑式编程都可以完成，
但是人们给出证明通常需要先构建一个辅助的 model，
对于 AI 来说这是比较难的了。

> Also, try to always have five or six problems you are working on. It

> over and over. (It’s much better to have five or six walls to bang
> your head against!) Seriously, taking a break from a problem always

并且像 V.V. 所说，这样放在脑子里的问题，叙述一定要清晰。

对于，三角形的三中线为什么交于一点的问题，
作者对 why 的解释确实构建了强大的 model，
而不只是用 logic。

证明 1：首先是以全等三角形为基础例子，
然后用对称性在这个特例中做证明，
然后再用摄影变换扩展到所有三角形。

> Which brings me to another piece of advice: improve your

> best explanation. Can you eliminate any unnecessary clutter or
> complexity? Can you find an entirely different approach that gives

> sculptors, and poets do the same thing.

Polya 的《怎样解题》也有类似的建议。
对于写程序而言也是如此。
但是对于写程序而言更难，
因为一个项目可能要投入很多时间才能完成，
但是如果能保持实现简单，就能更轻易地重写。

证明 2：连接中线形成一个小三角形，
不停地构造小三角形，可以收敛到一个点。
