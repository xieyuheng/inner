# 学习目的

看了《一位数学家的挽歌》之后想进一步看看，
Paul 会如何展示数学的艺术。

# Reality and Imagination

首先是 physical reality v.s. mathematical reality。

> The thing is, physical reality is a disaster. It’s way too
> complicated, and nothing is at all what it appears to be. Objects
> expand and contract with temperature, atoms fly on and off.  In
> particular, nothing can truly be measured. A blade of grass has no
> actual length. Any measurement made in this universe is necessarily
> a rough approximation. It’s not bad; it’s just the nature of the
> place. The smallest speck is not a point, and the thinnest wire is
> not a line.

> Mathematical reality, on the other hand, is imaginary. It can be as
> simple and pretty as I want it to be. I get to have all those
> perfect things I can’t have in real life. I will never hold a
> circle in my hand, but I can hold one in my mind. And I can measure
> it. Mathematical reality is a beautiful wonderland of my own
> creation, and I can explore it and think about it and talk about it
> with my friends.

> The former is important to me because I am in it,
> the latter because it is in me.

> My idea with this book is that we will design patterns. We’ll make
> patterns of shape and motion, and then we will try to understand our
> patterns and measure them. And we will see beautiful things!

比如在 Coxeter 关于多面体的书中，
开始就是列举多面体，然后做度量。
希望从这本书中，我能学会欣赏各种数学结构的方式。

计算机科学和编程的意义就在于，
在欣赏数学结构的同时，
我们还能用程序去模拟。

> But I won’t lie to you: this is going to be very hard work.
> Mathematical reality is an infinite jungle full of enchanting
> mysteries, but the jungle does not give up its secrets easily.  Be
> prepared to struggle, both intellectually and creatively. The truth
> is, I don’t know of any human activity as demanding of one’s
> imagination, intuition, and ingenuity. But I do it anyway.  I do it
> because I love it and because I can’t help it. Once you’ve been to
> the jungle, you can never really leave. It haunts your waking
> dreams.

# On Problems

# Part One: Size and Shape

## In which we begin our investigation of abstract geometrical figures.
## Symmetrical tiling and angle measurement.
## Scaling and proportion.
## Length, area, and volume.
## The method of exhaustion and its consequences.
## Polygons and trigonometry.
## Conic sections and projective geometry.
## Mechanical curves.

# Part Two: Time and Space

## Containing some thoughts on mathematical motion.
## Coordinate systems and dimension.
## Motion as a numerical relationship.
## Vector representation and mechanical relativity.
## The measurement of velocity.
## The differential calculus and its myriad uses.
## Some final words of encouragement to the reader.
