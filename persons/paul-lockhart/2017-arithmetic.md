# 学习目的

看了《一位数学家的挽歌》之后想进一步看看，
Paul 会如何展示数学的艺术。

# Dear Reader

> It’s fun to count and arrange things. We like doing it, and we have
> even developed it into something of a folk art. This art is called
> _arithmetic_. Arithmetic is the skillful arrangement of numerical
> information for ease of communication and comparison.  It is a fun
> and enjoyable activity of the mind and a relaxing and amusing
> pastime -- a kind of "symbol knitting," if you will.

这本书讲 Counting，与 Paul 的前一本书 Measurement 相互补充。

> My hope is that by reading this book you will be inspired to try it
> out for yourself and to experience firsthand the simple pleasure and
> satisfaction that comes with numerical fluency.

如果想像 Paul 一样写书来介绍我所爱的数学领域，
关键词可能是 Computing -- 定义为 directed change 的 computing。

# Things

注意论述中的 Why！

> Why exactly do we bother counting things? The truth is, we usually
> don’t. Most situations do not really call for any careful counting,
> just a sense that “we have plenty enough” or “we’re way short.”
> The main reason why we count is to _compare_.

"to compare" 的模型内没法解释所有的 counting 行为，
所以有下面的 "curiosity counting"。

> Then there is curiosity counting
> -- counting for the sake of pure wonder.

> Whatever the purpose or rationale, we occasionally find ourselves
> wanting to know how many of something there are.  This is where
> arithmetic begins, with _desire_. There’s no point counting
> something you don’t care about. Don’t ever do that.

> The point is that there are things, and we sometimes want to count
> them. Actually, there are some quantities that we don’t so much
> count as _measure_. What we do when we measure something -- and this
> could be an amount of milk, or someone’s height, or a piece of land
> -- is we take some agreed-upon amount, known as a _unit_ (e.g., a
> cup, an inch, or an acre), and we count the number of those. This
> has the effect of turning something smooth and continuous into
> something discrete and lumpy. So let’s confine ourselves to
> thinking about count- ing distinct individual items.

Paul 的前一本书的主题就是 Measurement。

> One problem is that we are a little too good at pattern
> recognition. Our brains are quite good at storing patterned
> information; we don’t do so well with random spatters. Here are two
> examples of sixness:

```
    o     o
       o                 o o
  o           o          o o
                         o o
       o
```

为什么只有摆整齐了才方便人们比较？
因为人们擅长识别模式，
所谓「整齐」就是具有模式。

> OK, so we don’t have instant number perception past five or so, and
> we have trouble with chaos and disorder. Also, we are careless
> daydreamers who can’t be trusted to perform one simple mind-numbing
> and repetitive task. So what do we do?  We come up with art and
> science, that’s what. We develop a creative and entertaining craft
> of counting well, using our pattern-seeking minds.

对于为什么我们发明算术，
给出了浪漫的，并且符合直觉主义的解释。
