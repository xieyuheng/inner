# Dear Reader

> It’s fun to count and arrange things. We like doing it, and we have
> even developed it into something of a folk art. This art is called
> _arithmetic_. Arithmetic is the skillful arrangement of numerical
> information for ease of communication and comparison.  It is a fun
> and enjoyable activity of the mind and a relaxing and amusing
> pastime -- a kind of "symbol knitting," if you will.

> My hope is that by reading this book you will be inspired to try it
> out for yourself and to experience firsthand the simple pleasure and
> satisfaction that comes with numerical fluency.
