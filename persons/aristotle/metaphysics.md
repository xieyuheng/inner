- sense : with delight
  experience : many times a sense
  art : cause, general judgement

- in the world of programming language,
  type is art,
  for it can be used to express general natural of functions.
  [type as theorem]

- some arts (only some) are useful.
  for example theorems about equality between functions
  can be used to optimize the running of functions in time and space.

- some useful optimizations are experiences,
  when we can express them by theorems, we have arts.

- artists can teach, but men of experience can not.
  because the principle cause of the experience
  is written down as theorem and can be told.

- by designing a programming language,
  I am also crafting a world
  in which experience and art can be explicitly distinguished.

- but for now I am only designing it mainly by my experiences.
  as a craft man indeed.

- I think the world of a programming language can be so fun
  if I apply the Metaphysics of Aristotle even more.
