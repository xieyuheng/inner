# My Motive

[2025-12-01] 在实现 x-lisp 这个编译器项目的时候，
想学一下项目管理方面的知识。

这本书主要是在总结大型软件项目中的失败的经验。

# Preface to the First Edition

> Although written as separable essays, there is a central argument
> contained especially in Chapters 2-7. Briefly, I believe that large
> programming projects suffer management problems different in kind
> from small ones, due to division of labor.  I believe the critical
> need to be the preservation of the conceptual integrity of the
> product itself. These chapters explore both the difficulties of
> achieving this unity and methods for doing so.  The later chapters
> explore other aspects of software engineering management.
