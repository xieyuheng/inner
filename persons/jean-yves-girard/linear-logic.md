# I. Introduction and abstract

Linear logic decomposes the operations of intuitionistic logic into more primitive ones.

Linear negation is constructive and involutive.

Linear sequent calculus is sequent calculus without weakening and contraction.

Proof-nets are natural deduction of linear logic which supports multiple conclusions.

Applications in computer science:

- If we do not use exponentials, we can control normalization.

- Linear logic connectives have obvious meaning in terms of parallel computation.

  We have two levels of connectives.

  - Multiplicative -- communication without problems of synchronization.
  - Additive -- handles synchronization

- To model the concept of cost.
