# 1 THE SYNTAX OF LINEAR LOGIC

## 1.1 The connectives of linear logic

When designing new logic like linear logic,
we should introduces new connectives
instead of modify classical or intuitionistic connectives.

### 1.1.1 Exponentials: actions vs situations

To view causality as reaction (physical or chemical).

Use exponentials `!` and `?` to mark stable truth,
i.e. the absence of any reaction.

Intuitionistic implication

```
A => B
```

can be decomposed into exponential and linear implication:

```
(!A) âˆ’o B
```
