# 1 Existence vs. essence

A dichotomy:

- **Essentialists**. Those who think that everything is already there,
  that one can but repeat archetypes.

  In logic, they believe in "inverted foundations":
  a system can be explained by a deeper "meta-system";
  which in turn can be explained by a meta-meta-system...
  and this never ends.

  Examples: Thomas Aquinus, set-theory, Cantor, Dedekind, etc.

- **Existentialists**. Those who do not find "deep" the fact of
  defining truth as supposedly done by Tarski
  "A ∧ B is true when A is true and B is true".

  The best possible law has value insofar as one can justify it,
  i.e., show the effect of non-observance.

  The existentialist world is a lawless world, in which
  contestation is total and constant.

  The opposition essence/existence is at the very heart of typing (Section 6.F).

## 6.F Essence, existence and typing

### 6.F.1 Locative phenomena.

There are indeed two readings of polymorphism,
depending if one starts with essence or existence.

- **Essence**. In this reading, the type is primitive, one constructs it,
  then one takes care of the objects.

  There is no real polymorphism,
  there is only one form (essence) for a given object.

  This is the viewpoint followed
  by the category-theoretic interpretations of logic.

- **Existence**. But one can instead contend that
  objects are anterior to their type, seen as an essence.

  This is the viewpoint of subtyping, this is also the viewpoint of ludics:
  an object may have several types, be representative of several essences.

### 6.F.2 Typing as essence

The difference between "pure" and typed objects
is the distinction between things as they are
and things as they should be.

This is also the difference between handicraft and industry.

- **Xie**: The latter means specification and interface.

### 6.F.3 Typing and computation

The activity consisting in manufacturing unique,
irreplaceable -- unless by themselves -- objects,
is called handicraft and does not stand mediocrity;
in opposition to industry which contents itself
with a not quite exciting contractual minimum,
in the style of Mc Donald’s.

Industry is obviously (and unfortunately) right.

Witness computer science:
one does not want programs written by little wizards,
one wants structures, modules, that one can
unscrew, modify, reassemble, etc.
