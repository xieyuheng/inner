<question>
  What is the meaning of "triangular" and  "idempotent"
  in "triangular rather than idempotent substitutions"?

# Introduction

<question>
  How nominal unification can be used to support
  variable binding and scope when implementing
  a relational interpreter for a subset of Scheme?

<question>
  How tabling can be used to improve termination behavior?

<project>
  Use logic programming to implement an
  extremely flexible lean tableau theorem prover.
</project>

<lookback>
  The "walk"-based algorithm for variable lookup in triangular substitutions.

  <generalization>
    Can this idea be used in other graph processing problems?

    For examples:

    - implementing cell-complex
    - implementing hypergraph

  </generalization>
