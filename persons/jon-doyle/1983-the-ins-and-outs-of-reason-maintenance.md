# Abstract

> To progress signicantly beyond current reason maintenance systems,
> we must formulate their structure and intended behavior precisely
> enough to analyze computational complexities and tradeoffs
> independently of the current set of limited implementation
> proposals.  This paper summarizes one such formulation, and
> indicates some unsolved practical problems for investigation in
> future reason maintenance systems.

可以用程序语言写出这里 state-domain 的定义，
但是还是没理解 interpret 的意义。
