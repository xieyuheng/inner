# 1. Introduction

## k-line

- minsky -
  how higher knowledge is represented in brain?
  maybe k-line?

  biologists do not think in this way, but :

  - you can not look for something,
    until you have the idea of it.

  - x -
    maybe the idea of k-line can be used in proof search

  - x -
    maybe the idea of k-line is just about sequential pattern

- why programming is a good medium
  for expressing poorly understood
  and sloppily-formulated ideas?

- There is a popular, widespread belief
  that computers can do only what they are programmed to do.
  This false belief is based on
  a confusion between form and content.

  A rigid grammar need not make
  for precision in describing processes.
  The programmer must be very precise
  in following the computer grammar,
  but the content he wants to be expressed remains free.

  The grammar is rigid
  because of the programmer who uses it,
  not because of the computer.
  The programmer does not even have to
  be exact in his own ideas
  - he may have a range of
    acceptable computer answers in mind
    and may be content if the computer's answers
    do not step out of this range.

  The programmer does not have to fixate the computer
  with particular processes.
  In a range of uncertainty
  he may ask the computer to generate new procedures,
  or he may recommend rules of selection
  and give the computer advice
  about which choices to make.
  - x -
    this is specially true
    when thinking about proof search

  Thus, computers do not have to be
  programmed with extremely clear and precise formulations
  of what is to be executed, or how to do it.

- x -
  I remember daniel dennett said that
  brain is like a vm
  which downloading byte code to execute
  while, the idea of k-line
  is picturing a computing model
  much like the actor model

  even if we find a way
  to help our prover to do proof search
  maybe the way we help it is as linear as k-line

- k -
  I think the first question to ask is
  what is k-point?
  only then
  can we ask about how to compose them to a k-line

- x -
  maybe there are not points
  only little k-lines compose to big k-lines
