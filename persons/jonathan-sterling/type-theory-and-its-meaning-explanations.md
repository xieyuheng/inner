# [Note] Terminology

The "meaning explanation" is called "semantical explanations" in Martin-Löf's paper
"On the meanings of the logical constants and the justification of logical laws".

This kind of semantics is almost a description summarize of a particularly implementation,
It is "almost", because in an implementation one also need to handle error report.
