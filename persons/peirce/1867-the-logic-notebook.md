I cannot explain the deep emotion with which I open this book
again. Here I write but never after read what I have written for what
I write is done in the process of forming a conception. Yet I cannot
forget that here are the germs of the theory of the categories which
is (if anything is) the gift I make to the world. That is my child. In
it I shall live when oblivion has me -- my body.

This matter of the logical principles of the different kinds of
inference is a difficult matter. One way of putting it would be this.

Every symbol denotes certain objects and connotes certain characters.
The symbol represents each of those objects to have each of those
characters. The symbol may be a false one; it may be that the objects
it denotes do not have the characters it connotes. But if S is M in
this sense -- not merely that M is a name for S but that it is the
name of a class of things among which S is and if M is P not merely in
the sense that --

    then S is P.

Here the principle is that

    That which is M is what M is.

Every one of the integrant parts of m is an integrant part of each
prime aliquot of m and vice versa.

A purely contentless principle. As a logical principle should be.

Now let us take up the synthetic arguments.

Whatever is a character of every thing denoted by M is a character of
M.  Whatever has every character of M is denoted by m.

Here are two principles. But they do not apply to induction and
hypothesis just as they stand.

Whatever is a common character of many things denoted by M is likely
to be a character of m.

That does not quite hit the point. It does not contain the idea that
the things must have been taken at random out of those denoted by M.
M.

In what point of view shall we regard this necessity for a random
selection?

Suppose we look at the matter thus. Certain things have a certain
character in common. It follows that there must be some genus of these
things which have the character. We cannot take any genus lower than
that which they are selected as belonging to. To take a higher one
would involve a perfectly arbitrary proposition.

I am convinced that this is a very awkward way of taking hold of the
matter.

Suppose we take it up another way.

For any subject or predicate we can substitute what?

Only that which this subject or predicate represents -- only that
which fulfils the function of that subject or predicate -- only that
which the subject or predicate represents to the proposition or to the
other terms of it.

Now a subject is a direct symbol of its subject to its predicate and a
predicate of its predicate to its subject.

But a subject is also an imperfect representation of that genus from
which it has been taken -- by which it is determined. It is not a
semeion sign of it as I have said -- it is an example of it.

A predicate is a representation of the thing of which it is a random
character -- a copy of it.

This is horribly vague.
