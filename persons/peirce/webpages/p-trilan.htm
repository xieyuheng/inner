	        <p>Peirce was the first logician to define three-valued logical
 connectives. In 1909, he defined four one-place three-valued 
connectives and six two-place three-valued connectives, all of which 
were rediscovered by later logicians. Peirce's motivation was to 
accommodate within formal logic a specific, narrow range of propositions
 he took to be neither true nor false, viz. propositions that predicate 
of a breach in mathematical or temporal continuity one of the properties
 that is a boundary-property relative to that breach.<br>
      <b>Key words:</b> Triadic Logic, Continuity, Limit, Bivalence, Truth</p>

      <p><b>Peirce's Three-valued Connectives</b><br>
Charles Peirce was the first logician to define logical operators for a 
many-valued system of logic.[1]  In February 1909, on three pages of a 
notebook in which he recorded his thoughts on logic (MS 339), he defined
 several three-valued connectives using the truth-table, or matrix, 
method.[2]   The system of triadic logic that Peirce envisioned employs 
the values "V", "F", and "L". He interpreted "V" and "F" as "verum" 
("true") and "falsum" ("false"), respectively, and he interpreted the 
third value, "L", as "the limit."</p>

<p>Peirce's work on many-valued logical connectives was first brought to
 light by Max Fisch and Atwell Turquette (1966). As Fisch and Turquette 
describe, it had long been thought that Jan <img src="p-trilan_files/lslash.gif" vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0" align="ABSBOTTOM">ukasiewicz
 (1920, 1930) and Emil Post (1921) had developed the first operators for
 three-valued logic.[3]  But Peirce is now recognized as the first to 
use the truth-table method to define three-valued operators. Subsequent 
to the publication of Fisch and Turquette's paper, the formal aspects of
 Peirce's three-valued connectives were explored extensively by 
Turquette (1967, 1969, 1972, 1973, 1976, 1978, 1981/4).</p>

<p>In conducting his triadic experiments, Peirce defined four different 
one-place connectives and six different two-place connectives.  Peirce's
 three-valued one-place connectives are:</p>

<p> It is unclear from what Peirce wrote how satisfied he was with this 
work. On one page he wrote that "Triadic Logic is universally true"; but
 on another, he wrote that "All this is mighty close to nonsense." 
Whatever Peirce's own opinion of his work, his operators were sufficient
 for a functionally complete system of three-valued logic. All possible 
operators definable by three-valued matrices can be defined in terms of 
just two of Peirce's operators: <img src="p-trilan_files/theta.gif" vspace="0" hspace="0" align="absbottom"> and <b><font size="+1">´</font></b>. (Fisch and Turquette 1966:77)</p>


<p><b>Philosophical Motivations</b><br>

Peirce characterized triadic logic as</p>

<p>
</p><dir>
that logic which ... recognizes that every proposition, S is P, is 
either true, or false, or else S has a lower mode of being such that it 
can neither be determinately P, nor determinately not-P, but is at the 
limit between P and not P. (MS 339, Feb. 23, 1909)[5]
</dir>
<p></p>

<p>In experimenting with many-valued connectives, Peirce was motivated 
by the desire to accommodate within formal logic propositions which are 
neither true nor false; and this means that he believed that some 
propositions are, indeed, neither true nor false.  He thus rejected the 
Principle of Bivalence (PB), according to which any proposition is 
either true or else false.[6]</p>

<p>Commentators disagree about Peirce's philosophical reasons for 
rejecting PB and acknowledging propositions that are at "the limit" 
between true and false. Because of potentially misleading comments 
Peirce made regarding the principle of excluded middle (PEM) <b>[see PRINCIPLES OF EXCLUDED MIDDLE AND CONTRADICTION]</b>,
 some have taken him to have intended "L" to value object-general 
propositions (roughly, universally quantified propositions). This has 
the odd consequence that, for example, the proposition "All bachelors 
are unmarried" is neither true nor false. But for Peirce, to say that 
PEM does not apply to a proposition "S is P" is not to imply that "S is 
P" is neither true nor false.  The non-application of PEM to general 
propositions did not motivate the development of Peirce's three-valued 
connectives.</p>

<p>Others have assumed that Peirce meant "L" to be taken by what he 
called "vague" propositions, presumably because he held that the 
principle of contradiction (PC) does not apply to such propositions. 
[See Peirce's Logic of Vagueness; Principles of Excluded Middle and 
Contradiction] By "vague proposition" Peirce meant object-indefinite 
propositions (roughly, existentially quantified propositions). So the 
view that "L" values vague propositions has the odd consequence that, 
for example, the proposition "Some US President is from Texas" is both 
true and false. But for Peirce, to say that PC does not apply to a 
proposition "S is P" is not to imply that "S is P" is both true and 
false.  The non-application of PC to vague propositions did not motivate
 the development of Peirce's three-valued connectives.</p>

<p>Still others have assumed that Peirce intended his third value to be taken by modal propositions. <b>[See <a href="http://www.digitalpeirce.fee.unicamp.br/lane/em.htm#modality">MODALITY</a>]</b>
 This is because Peirce wrote that PEM does not apply to assertions of 
necessity and PC does not apply to assertions of possibility. But a 
correct understanding of Peirce's "principles of excluded middle and 
contradiction" shows that these comments do not suggest that a value 
other than "true" and "false" is needed for modal propositions. 
Considerations from quantum physics have led others to suggest that 
Peirce intended "L" to be taken by any proposition containing 
"scientifically sound predicates" (Jauhari 1985), including propositions
 that express natural laws. But this interpretation is not at all 
supported by the textual evidence.</p>

<p>In fact, Peirce intended his third value to be taken only by 
propositions that predicate of a breach in mathematical or temporal 
continuity one of the properties that is a boundary-property relative to
 that breach. I call such propositions <i>boundary-propositions</i>. To 
see that this is the sort of proposition Peirce intended "L" to value, 
we must recognize the distinction between saying that a logical 
principle does not <i>apply</i> to a proposition and saying that it is <i>false</i>
 with regard to a proposition.  Peirce's view is that a principle can 
only be false with regard to a proposition if it applies to that 
proposition. (MS 641:24 2/3 - 3/4, 1909) So to say that a given 
principle does not apply to a proposition is to imply that the principle
 <i>is not</i> false with regard to that proposition.</p>

<p>This distinction is important to a correct understanding of Peirce's 
triadic logic because he intended his triadic logic to accommodate 
propositions with regard to which PEM <i>is</i> false, and thus to which PEM <i>applies</i>.
  This means, first, that L-propositions (propositions that take 
Peirce's third value, "L") have individual (non-general) subject-terms. 
It also means that L-propositions do not express necessity, i.e., they 
are not of the form "S must be P".  Further, Peirce's view seems to have
 been that PC is true with regard to L-propositions; and this means that
 PC applies to L-propositions, and therefore that L-propositions have 
definite (non-vague) subject-terms and that they do not express 
possibility, i.e., they are not of the form "S may be P" or "S can be 
P". In sum: L-propositions have singular (individual and definite) 
subject-terms and are non-modal (they express neither necessity nor 
possibility).</p>

<p>On one of the pages of the logic notebook in which he defined his 
three-valued connectives, Peirce gave an example involving an ink-blot. 
He seems to have intended that example as an illustration of an 
object-singular, non-modal proposition that takes "L" as its value:<br>

</p><dir>
Thus, a blot is made on the sheet.  Then every point of the sheet is 
unblackened or is blackened.  But there are points on the boundary line,
 and those points are insusceptible of being unblackened or of being 
blackened, since these predicates refer to the area about S and a line 
has no area about any point of it. (MS 339, February 23, 1909)
</dir>

The question Peirce found interesting was whether the boundary between 
the ink blot and the rest of the paper is black or non-black.  His 
answer, it seems, was "<i>neither.</i>"  Again, Peirce described an L-proposition "S is P" as follows:<br>

<dir>
S has a lower mode of being such that it can neither be determinately P,
 nor determinately not-P, but is at the limit between P and not P. (MS 
339, February 23, 1909)
</dir>

The boundary between the black ink blot and the non-black paper is 
neither black nor non-black, and the (object-singular, non-modal) 
propositions "The boundary is black" and "The boundary is non-black" are
 neither true nor false.  Each is the sort of proposition that Peirce 
thought should take the value "L".  The boundary between the black and 
the non-black areas of the paper is a <i>continuity-breach</i>; it is a 
line in an otherwise uninterrupted surface. Peirce intended "L" to value
 propositions that predicate of a mathematical or temporal 
continuity-breach one of the properties that is a boundary-property 
relative to that breach. Such propositions are <i>boundary-propositions</i>.<p></p>

<p>This might seem strange at first.  Why, after all, would Peirce take 
boundary-propositions to be interesting or important enough to motivate 
him to introduce three-valued connectives?  The answer lies in the fact 
that the notion of continuity was itself of supreme philosophical 
importance for Peirce. That the question of continuity-breaches and 
their boundary-properties was for him not simply an afterthought or a 
relatively unimportant aspect of the broader issue of the nature of 
continuity, is indicated by the fact that each time he revised his 
definition of continuity in a significant way, his position regarding 
continuity-breaches and their boundary-properties changed as well. (Lane
 1999)</p>

<p><b>Blocking the Way of Inquiry?</b><br>

What are the consequences of Peirce's rejection of PB for his pragmatic 
account of truth, i.e., his account of truth as that which would be 
agreed upon at the hypothetical, ideal limit of inquiry?  As noted by 
Cheryl Misak (1991), Peirce did not intend (at least, not from the 1890s
 on) to give a biconditional definition of "truth" but instead held that
 what she calls the Truth to Inquiry Conditional is a regulative 
principle of inquiry, a hope that must be adopted by an inquirer with 
regard to the question she is investigating:</p>

<p>
</p><dir><i>The Truth to Inquiry Conditional</i>: If "S is P" is true, <i>then</i>, if inquiry relevant to whether S is P were pursued as far as it could fruitfully go, it would be agreed that S is P.</dir><p></p>

<p>Peirce's view of bivalence seems to have been the same.  So in 
rejecting bivalence with regard to a proposition "S is P", Peirce was in
 effect giving up the hope that, if inquiry with regard to whether S is P
 were pursued as far as it could fruitfully go, belief about whether S 
is P would never be settled.</p>

<p>This seems to be in tension with Peirce's injunction against blocking
 the "way of inquiry" (1.135, c.1898)[7]; after all, one way to block 
the way of inquiry is to assert, with regard to a given question, that 
inquiry would never result in consensus regarding the answer to that 
question.  Had he claimed that a broad class of proposition (modal 
propositions, say, or, propositions containing "scientifically sound 
predicates") fails to be either true or false, Peirce himself would have
 been guilty of blocking a relatively wide avenue of inquiry.  But he 
rejected bivalence only for a very narrow range of propositions: 
boundary-propositions. Thus, Peirce was guilty of blocking, not a wide 
avenue of inquiry, but only a narrow alley-way.</p>
