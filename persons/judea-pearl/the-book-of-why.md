# INTRODUCTION Mind over Data

The aim is to build a mathematical model of cause and effect -- a calculus of causation.

- **Xie**: How does the model of Judea Pearl relates to logic?

The calculus of causation consists of two languages:

- causal diagrams, to express what we know,
- and a symbolic language, resembling algebra,
  to express what we want to know.

The causal diagrams are simply dot-and-arrow pictures
that summarize our existing scientific knowledge.

The dots represent quantities of interest, called "variables",
and the arrows represent known or suspected causal relationships between those variables
-- namely, which variable "listens" to which others.

- **Xie**: How does causal diagrams relates to
  reactive programming
  and Sussman's propagator model?

These diagrams are extremely easy to draw, comprehend, and use,
and the reader will find dozens of them in the pages of this book.
If you can navigate using a map of one-way streets,
then you can understand causal diagrams,
and you can solve the type of questions
posed at the beginning of this introduction.
