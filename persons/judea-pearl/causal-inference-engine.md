# NOTE

- Maybe I can write a book with Dan on this topic.

  - There are so many good puzzles in this topic.

- When studying the topic, I should view the above as a goal.

# TODO

- What would a Causal Inference Engine be like?
- What are the first steps to build a Causal Inference Engine?
- Can we use TDD for the API design?
- Is it possible to implement the Causal Inference Engine as two parts,
  - one for graph and do calculus
  - one for random variable
