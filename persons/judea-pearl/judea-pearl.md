# Judea Pearl Tribute Symposium: Causality

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78EmmdfOcI8>

- Science should be taught with its history.

- Just solving constraint satisfaction problems is not enough,
  there's something there about persistence things in the world
  that is not encoded but should be encoded,
  we call it environment.
  By the way, my definition of causality is
  encoding of the invariant elements in the environment.
