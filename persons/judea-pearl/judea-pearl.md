# Judea Pearl Tribute Symposium: Causality

[ [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78EmmdfOcI8) ]

- Science should be taught with its history.

  After been told the stories of the persons who did great science,
  you are under the illusion that you can do too.

- Just solving constraint satisfaction problems is not enough,
  there's something there about persistence things in the world
  that is not encoded but should be encoded,
  we call it environment.
  By the way, my definition of causality is
  encoding of the invariant elements in the environment.

- An equation contains more information than its solution,
  for an equation we can ask,
  what will happen to the solution
  if we change the connection,
  but for the solution,
  all information about connection and direction are lost.

  - Algebra of assignments and structural causal model.

- The disciplines of computer scinece
  and the paradigm of artifical intelligance
  that force us to explicate things in algorithmic details
  and force us to teach those details to brainless robot,
  and in this way not only to achieve robot emulating us,
  but us understanding ourselves,
  and to paraphrase Descartes, I would say,

  > **I compute, therefore I think**.
