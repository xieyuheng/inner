# Judea Pearl Tribute Symposium: Causality

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78EmmdfOcI8>

- Science should be taught with its history.

- Just solving constraint satisfaction problems is not enough,
  there's something there about persistence things in the world
  that is not encoded but should be encoded,
  we call it environment.
  By the way, my definition of causality is
  encoding of the invariant elements in the environment.

- An equation contains more information than its solution,
  for an equation we can ask,
  what will happen to the solution
  if we change the connection,
  but for the solution,
  all information about connection and direction are lost.

  - Algebra of assignments and structural causal model.
