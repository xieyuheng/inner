# (1932) on the existence of independent axiom systems for infinite sentence systems

## notations and some lemmas

## an infinite closed sentence system possessing no independent axiom system

## construction of an independent axiom system for a given denumerably infinite closed linear sentence system

# (1933) on the relation between intuitionist and classical arithmetic

# (1935) investigations into logical deduction

## 術語

- natural deduction 自然演繹

- sequent calculus 則式演算 [相繼式演算]

# (1936) the consistency of elementary number theory

## reflections on the purpose andpossibility of consistency proofs

### the antinomies of set theory and their significance for mathematicsas a whole

### how are consistency proofs possible

There can be no "absolute consistency proof".

A consistency proof can merely
reduce the correctness of certain forms of inference
to the correctness of other forms of inference.

## the formalization of elementary number theory

### the formalization of the propositions occurring in elementary number theory

```
x: Number, (x is even number) ->
y, z: Number, (y + z = x), (y is prime), (z is prime)
```

### example of a proof from elementary number theory

### the formalization of the forms of inference occurring in elementary number theory

### derived concepts and axioms in elementary number theory

## disputable and indisputable forms of inference in elementarynumber theory

### mathematics over finite domains of objects

### decidable concepts and propositions over an infinite domain ofobjects

### the "actualist" interpretation of transfinite propositions

### finitist interpretation of the connectives OR, AND, EXIST and ALL in transfinite propositions

### The connectives IMPLY and NOT in transfinite propositions: the intuitionist view

## the consistency proof

### the elimination of the symbols OR, EXIST and IMPLY from a given derivation

### the reduction of sequents

### reduction steps on derivations

### ordinal numbers and proof of finiteness

## reflections on the consistency proof

### the forms of inference used in the consistency proof

### consequences of the consistency proof

# (1936) the consistency of the simple theory of types

# (1936) the concept of infinity in mathematics

# (1938) the present state of research into the foundations of mathematics

# (1938) new version of the consistency proof for elementary number theory

# (1943) provability and nonprovability of restricted transfinite induction in elementary number theory

# (1954) fusion of several complete inductions
