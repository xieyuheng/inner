# My Motive

[2025-07-11] 为了学习 lattice theory 的展示论（presentation theory），
以用于类型系统的设计。

# My Notes

第一作者 peter crawley 是 dilworth 的学生。

# Preface

> Our purpose in this book is two-fold:
>
> - first, to illustrate the depth and beauty of lattice theory by
>   systematically developing a body of results at the heart of the
>   subject including a representative sample of its most profound
>   results;
>
> - and second, as lattice theoretic techniques are useful in many
>   branches of mathematics, to broadly illustrate the more important
>   tools and techniques of lattice theory.

> ... Generally, our focus is on lattice structure theory, and we have
> tended to include those results that give insight into how lattices
> are put together and how they behave under certain assumptions.
> Also, the reader will note the absence of “applications;" we have
> involved other branches of mathematics only insofar as they give
> lattice theoretical insights.
