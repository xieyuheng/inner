***** 1.1 Expressed aim and topics covered

      - In the preface of the Principia, Newton wrote :
        Rational Mechanics will be the science of motions
        resulting from any forces whatsoever,
        and of the forces required to produce any motions,
        accurately proposed and demonstrated.

        And therefore we offer this work
        as mathematical principles of philosophy.
        For all the difficulty of philosophy
        seems to consist in this --
        from the phenomena of motions
        to investigate the forces of Nature,
        and then from these forces
        to demonstrate the other phenomena.
