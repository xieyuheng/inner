* syntactic structures (1957)

  By pushing a precise but inadequate formulation
  to an unacceptable conclusion,
  we can often expose the exact source of this inadequacy
  and, consequently, gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.

  Obscure and intuition-bound notions
  can neither lead to absurd conclusions
  nor provide new and correct ones,
  and hence they fail to be useful in two important rcspccts.


  - a grammar of L =
    a device that gencrates all of the grammatical scqucnces of L,
    and none of the ungrammatical ones.
    i.e. a predicate to separate the grammatical sequences
    from the ungrammatical sequences.

  - 正如一個人能夠生成和接受符合語法的句子

  - grammatical = acceptablc to a native speaker

  grammar is autonomous and independent of meaning,

  - parsing -- constituent analysis
