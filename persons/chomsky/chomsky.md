# (1957) syntactic structures

By pushing a precise but inadequate formulation
to an unacceptable conclusion,
we can often expose the exact source of this inadequacy
and, consequently, gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.

Obscure and intuition-bound notions
can neither lead to absurd conclusions
nor provide new and correct ones,
and hence they fail to be useful in two important rcspccts.

- a grammar of L =
  a device that gencrates all of the grammatical scqucnces of L,
  and none of the ungrammatical ones.
  i.e. a predicate to separate the grammatical sequences
  from the ungrammatical sequences.

- 正如一個人能夠生成和接受符合語法的句子

- grammatical = acceptablc to a native speaker

grammar is autonomous and independent of meaning,

- parsing -- constituent analysis
