这篇论文在 1997-interaction-combinators 之前。
需要看一下从 1990-interaction-nets 开始 inet 的发展。

# 1 introduction

> If we consider the interpretation of proofs as programs, say in
> intuitionistic logic, the question of equality between proofs
> becomes crucial: The syntax introduces meaningless distinctions
> whereas the (denotational) semantics makes excessive
> identifications. This question does not have a simple answer in
> general, but it leads to the notion of proof-net, which is one of
> the main novelties of linear logic. This has been already explained
> in [Gir87] and [GLT89].

> The notion of interaction net introduced in [Laf90] comes from an
> attempt to implement the reduction of these proof-nets. It happens
> to be a simple model of parallel computation, and so it can be
> presented independently of linear logic. However, we think that it
> is also useful to relate the exact origin of interaction nets,
> especially for readers with some knowledge in linear logic. We take
> this opportunity to give a survey of the theory of proof-nets,
> including a new proof of the sequentialization theorem.
