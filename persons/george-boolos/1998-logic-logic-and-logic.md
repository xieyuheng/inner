这是 Boolos 的论文集。
标题很吸引人，
读来领略逻辑学家的风采，
外加开拓眼界。

# studies on set theory and the nature of logic

> Georg Cantor, the founder of set theory, published neither explicit
> axioms nor an intuitive account of the conception of set he was
> assuming.

> Gottlob Frege, the founder of modern logic, did give explicit axioms
> in the logical system he proposed as a foundation for mathematics.
> Unfortunately, he assumed a naive conception of set, on which for
> any condition there is a set whose elements are all and only the
> things for which that condition holds; and such a conception leads
> to contradiction when applied to the condition "is a set that is not
> an element of itself."

为了解决悖论 Russell 和 Zermelo 分别给出了不同的类型论：

- Russell -- stratified
- Zermelo -- cumulative

> ... he [Zermelo] later gave an intuitive account of the underlying
> conception of set he was assuming, which also is widely accepted
> among set theorists today.

> Sometimes the temporal metaphor of sets formed at later and later
> stages is used in place of the spatial metaphor of sets lying at
> higher and higher levels, in which case one speaks of the iterative
> conception.

这个 iterative 我还是第一次听说。

希望 Boolos 的文章能解释 Zermelo 公理的直觉，
并因此让我轻松记住这些公理。
