# 介绍

> Its subject is the relation between provability and modal logic, a
> branch of logic invented by Aristotle but much disparaged by
> philosophers and virtually ignored by mathematicians.  Here it
> receives its first scientific application since its invention.

> Modal logic is concerned with the notions of necessity and
> possibility. What George Boolos does is to show how the concepts,
> techniques, and methods of modal logic shed brillant light on the
> most important logical discovery of the twentieth century: the
> incompleteness theorems of Kurt Godel and the "self-referential"
> sentences constructed in their proof. The book explores the effects
> of reinterpreting the notions of necessity and possibility to mean
> provability and consistency. It describes the first application of
> quantified modal logic to formal provability as well as the results
> of applying modal logic to well-known formal systems of mathematics.
