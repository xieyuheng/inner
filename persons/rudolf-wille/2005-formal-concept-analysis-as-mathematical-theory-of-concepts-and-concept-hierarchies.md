title: Formal Concept Analysis as Mathematical Theory of Concepts and Concept Hierarchies
year: 2005

# 学习动机

我大致浏览了以下，
看到论文里可能在用 `... => ...` 这种 implication
来定义 concept lattice。
首先要学会这个。

# 1 Formal Concept Analysis, Mathematics, and Logic

> Only after more than a decade of development, the connections to
> Philosophical Logics of human thought became clearer, mainly through
> Charles Sanders Peirce's late philosophy.

> The concern of that paper ("Communicative Rationality, Logic, and
> Mathematics") is to explain and to substantiate the following
> thesis:

> The aim and meaning of mathematics finally lie in the fact that
> mathematics is able to effectively support the rational
> communication of humans.

> Here we only recall the key arguments founding this thesis:

> First, logical thinking as expression of human reason graps actual
> realities by the main forms ofhuman thought: concepts, judgments,
> and conclusions (cf. [Ka88], p.6).

"conclusions" 一词可能代表完整的逻辑推演系统。

> Second, mathematical thinking abstracts logical human thinking for
> developing a cosmos of forms of potential realities (see [Pe92],
> p.121).

只有通过 "potential realities" 联系到实际，才符合皮尔士的实用主义。

> Since concepts are also prerequisites for the formation of judgments
> and conclusions, we can adapt the above thesis to Formal Concept
> Analysis as follows:

> The aim and meaning of Formal Concept Analysis as mathematical
> theory of concepts and concept hierarchies is to support the
> rational communication of humans by mathematically developing
> appropriate conceptual structures which can be logically activated.

我觉得更符合实用主义的动机是，
FCA 可以帮助人们从已有的数据发现新的概念。

# 2 Concepts and Formal Concepts

> Concepts can be philosophically understood as the basic units of
> thought formed in dynamic processes within social and cultural
> environments.

"the basic units of thought" 就是说概念是人们思考的基础对象，
而这种假定，就是构建了一个人与世界的模型，去解释现象。
皮尔士的实用主义，也在于构造这样的模型。

回想 "The Book of Why"，
当一位提问者问 Why 一类的问题的时候，
回答者回答的形式是在一个模型中解释 Why，
而提问者所期待的也是 Why 在一个模型中被解释。
