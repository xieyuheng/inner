# 1. Helping the student

# 2. Questions, recommendations, mental operations

# 3. Generality

# 4. Common sense

# 5. Teacher and student. Imitation and practice

# 6. Four phases

Trying to find the solution,
we may repeatedly change our point of view,
our way of looking at the problem.
We have to shift our position again and again.

Our conception of the problem is likely to be rather incomplete when we start the work;
our outlook is different when we have made some progress;
it is again different when we have almost obtained the solution.

- (1) understand -- clarity
- (2) plan -- connections
- (3) carry out -- check each steps
- (4) look back -- to gain the most from our works

It is important to go through all the phases,
to advance while avoiding obvious mistakes,
and to gain the most from our works.

Note that:

- (1) understand and (2) plan -- like DDD
- (3) carry out -- like TDD
- (4) look back -- like refactoring

About looking back:

When looking back a solution, we should try to shift context, think the context larger,
like creative art showing the viewer context they had not noticed before

# 7. Understanding the problem

The student should understand the problem.
But he should not only understand it, he should also desire its solution.

If the student is lacking in understanding or in interest,
it is not always his fault; the problem should be well chosen,
not too difficult and not too easy, natural and interesting,
and some time should be allowed for natural and interesting presentation.
