# 1. Helping the student

# 2. Questions, recommendations, mental operations

It seemed to the author that it might be worth while
to collect and to group questions and suggestions
which are typically helpful in discussing problems with students.

The list we study contains questions and suggestions of this sort,
carefully chosen and arranged; they are equally useful
to the problem-solver who works by himself.

If the reader is sufficiently acquainted with the list
and can see, behind the suggestion, the action suggested,
he may realize that the list enumerates, indirectly,
mental operations typically useful for the solution of problems.

These operations are listed in the order
in which they are most likely to occur.

# 3. Generality

# 4. Common sense

# 5. Teacher and student. Imitation and practice

学生必须关心问题，老师为了让学生关心问题，可以把自己的解题过程表演地很戏剧化。

# 6. Four phases

Trying to find the solution,
we may repeatedly change our point of view,
our way of looking at the problem.
We have to shift our position again and again.

Our conception of the problem is likely to be rather incomplete when we start the work;
our outlook is different when we have made some progress;
it is again different when we have almost obtained the solution.

- (1) understand -- clarity
- (2) plan -- connections
- (3) carry out -- check each steps
- (4) look back -- to gain the most from our works

It is important to go through all the phases,
to advance while avoiding obvious mistakes,
and to gain the most from our works.

Note that:

- (1) understand and (2) plan -- like DDD
- (3) carry out -- like TDD
- (4) look back -- like refactoring

About looking back:

When looking back a solution, we should try to shift context, think the context larger,
like creative art showing the viewer context they had not noticed before

# 7. Understanding the problem

The student should understand the problem.
But he should not only understand it, he should also desire its solution.

If the student is lacking in understanding or in interest,
it is not always his fault; the problem should be well chosen,
not too difficult and not too easy, natural and interesting,
and some time should be allowed for natural and interesting presentation.
