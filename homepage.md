### Hi, I'm Xie Yuheng ^-^/

I am a programmer, and I work as a full-stack web developer.

I share my ideas about _programming_, _mathematics_ and _philosophy_
through my [translations](TRANSLATIONS.md) and [papers](PAPERS.md).

A project can be a wonderful journey,
where we aiming to get somewhere, while also
practicing our skills and enjoy being on the road.

App projects I'm working on:

- [Readonly.Link](https://readonly.link)
- [FiDB](https://fidb.app)
- [Mimor](https://mimor.app)

Programming language projects:

- [iNet](https://inet.run)
- [Cicada](https://cicada-lang.org)

X series software library projects:

- [x-node](https://github.com/xieyuheng/x-node)
- [x-markdown](https://github.com/xieyuheng/x-markdown)
- [x-server](https://github.com/xieyuheng/x-server)

Curious? Come to see my [inner universe](https://github.com/xieyuheng/inner).
