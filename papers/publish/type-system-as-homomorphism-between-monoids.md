# Abstract

We demonstrate how to view a type system as a homomorphism between two monoids,
where the space of types is monoid, the space of terms is also a monoid,
and the homomorphism is the `infer` function of the type system.

We use a concrete example to demonstrate this idea,
in our example the space of types is _linear logic propositions_,
and the space of terms is a _programming language like Forth and Joy_.

Some key points of our demonstration:

- Negation of linear logic should NOT be interpreted as "implying false",
  but be interpreted as type of _linear assignment_ (thus constructive).

- Linear logic additive connectives can be interpreted without concurrency.

- Type errors will be captured by a special `Error` element.

# Introduction

First a homomorphism between two monoids, can be viewed as a type system.
We can view this homomorphism as the `infer` function,
given a term it can infer the type of this term.

- TODO Use presentation of of monoids to show some examples.

The reverse is also true, given a type system,
we can construct two monoids to be the space of terms and types.
And we can interpret concepts in type system as equations in monoid.

# Example: a syntax for the terms of linear logic

Let's define two concrete monoids and a homomorphism between them,
to see the idea of this paper in action.

We call the homomorphism `infer`, its domain _terms_, its codomain _types_.

The types will be _linear logic propositions_.

The terms will be a _programming language
like [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language))
and [Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language))_.

We take _the free monoid of symbols_ as the base monoid (the building block).

- An element of the monoid is defined to be a list of symbols.

- The empty list is the identity element of the monoid,
  we also write it as `empty` for convenience.

We use whitespace as infix notation
to denote the binary operation
of the monoid (instead of using an explicit infix notation like `â€¢`).

If `A` and `B` are elements, so is `A B`.

Example elements:

- `A`
- `A B`
- `A B B A`
- `A C D C`

Along with our definition of monoid,
we also define a homomorphism called `infer`.

Since it is a homomorphism, we have:

```
infer(A B) = infer(A) infer(B)
```

We define two ways to construct new elements.

- **Negation:**

  We preserve `neg` as a special symbol to denote negation.

  If `A` is an element, `A neg` is also an element.

  Note that this is NOT `A`'s inverse element,
  but only a _postfix notation_ to construct new element
  (If we really can get the inverse element of any element,
  we will be working within group instead of monoid).

- **Abstraction (anonymous sequent):**

  If `A` is an element, so is `{ A }`,
  and we call it "abstraction".

We specify three equivalent relations between monoid elements:

- **Negation cancels an element from the right side:**

  ```
  A A neg == empty
  ```

- **Negation is involutive:**

  ```
  A neg neg == A
  ```

- **Abstraction can be applied:**

  We preserve `apply` as a special symbol to denote application of abstraction.

  ```
  { A } apply == A
  ```

We introduce a syntactic shorthand for writing negation in abstraction,

```
{ A B -- C D }
```

is the same as

```
{ A neg B neg C D }
```

At the beginning we took _the free monoid of symbols_ as our base monoid,
instead of using any symbols as generaters,
now we refine this base monoid by a limitation saying:

- Only symbols defined by `datatype` keyword are elements of our monoid.

An exmaple of datatype definition is the following:

```
datatype Nat {
  zero { -- Nat }
  add1 { Nat -- Nat }
}
```

It defines one _type constructor_ -- `Nat`,
and two _data constructors_ -- `Nat.zero` and `Nat.add1`.

It also defines the homomorphism for these elements:

- Let's call the homomorphism `infer`.

```
infer(Nat.zero) = Nat
infer(Nat.add1) = Nat neg Nat
```

TODO define `Type`

TODO define `error` element and `Error` type

TODO use monoid equations to interpret type variable and unification

TODO define linear assignment

```
claim swap { 'A 'B -- 'B 'A }

define swap {
  let (x) let (y) x y
}
```

## Nat

```
datatype Nat {
  zero { -- Nat }
  add1 { Nat -- Nat }
}

claim add { Nat Nat -- Nat }

define add {
  match {
    zero {}
    add1 { add Nat.add1 }
  }
}

rule Nat.zero add {}
rule Nat.add1 add { add Nat.add1 }

claim two { -- Nat }

  Nat.zero Nat.add1
  Nat.zero Nat.add1

}

## Trivial

```
datatype Trivial {
  sole { -- Trivial }
}
```

## List

```
datatype List {
  null { 'A List }
  cons { 'A 'A List -- 'A List }
}

claim append { 'A List 'A List -- 'A List }

rule List.null append {}
rule List.cons append { let (head) append head List.cons }

define append {
  match {
   null {}
   cons { let (head) append head List.cons }
  }
}

claim six_soles { -- Trivial List }

define six_soles {
  List.null Trivial.sole List.cons Trivial.sole List.cons Trivial.sole List.cons
  List.null Trivial.sole List.cons Trivial.sole List.cons Trivial.sole List.cons
  append
}
```
