# What is logic?

Logic is one kind of study of formal languages.

Logic is concerned with the properties of, and relations between:

- syntax -- formulae, sentences, ...
- semantics -- truth, validity, semantic consequence, ...
- inferences -- proofs, theorems, soundness, completeness, ...
  - probabilistic -- about uncertainty and chance
  - inductive -- generalize what we have observed
  - deductive -- draw conclusions by virtue of the syntactic structure of statements.

meta properties:

- strong soundness -- every theorem can be derived from inference rules is a semantic consequence of the axioms.
- strong completeness -- every semantic consequence can be derived by syntactic inferences as a theorem.

task of logician:

- to devise suitable language,
  to express sensible inference rules,
  to reason about statements.

- use inductive reasoning to design deductive rules.
