#+title: Warren's Abstract Machine

* [note]

*** motivation

    - I am reading this because I want to implement cicada
      and the new implementing strategy
      is to use the type system as a logic programming first

    - I have the following understanding :
      - a [typical] dependent type system
        in lack of reification and logic programming interfaces
      - a [typical] logic programming
        in lack of the informations
        about the names of inference rules
        and in lack of the type system

    - minikanren and ukanren are cool
      but they rely on lambda

    - how to do it without lambda ?
      will we inevitably re-implement
      all that lambda did for us with no gain
      and make things more complicated than them need to be ?

*** ukanren

    #+begin_src cicada
    var-t = uuid-t
    term-t = + (var-t ...)
    subst-t = dict-t (var-t term-t)
    walk : -- var-t subst-t -- term-t
    deep-walk : -- term-t subst-t -- term-t
    // acting subst-t on term-t
    //   subst-t is compose-able
    /    -- a category -- a preorder
    extend : -- var-t term-t subst-t -- subst-t
    goal-t = -- subst-t -> stream-t (subst-t)
    // but I do not use the above alias
    //   to be clear about the use of lambda
    // note that we have a monad here
    // also note that
    //   if the language is not lazy
    //   to use infinite stream
    //   special lambda tricks are needed
    unify : -- subst-t term-t term-t -> subst-t
    == : -- term-t term-t -> -- subst-t -> stream-t (subst-t)
    // and the stream-t returned by ==
    //   can either has 1 or 0 subst
    //   == is the primitive goal constructor
    disj : // logic or
      -- subst-t -> stream-t (subst-t)
         subst-t -> stream-t (subst-t)
      -> subst-t -> stream-t (subst-t)
    conj : // logic and
      -- subst-t -> stream-t (subst-t)
         subst-t -> stream-t (subst-t)
      -> subst-t -> stream-t (subst-t)
    mplus : // stream append
      // not really appending
      //   because we need to interleaving the stream
      //   to avoid depth first searching
      -- stream-t (subst-t) stream-t (subst-t)
      -> stream-t (subst-t)
    bind : // stream map
      -- stream-t (subst-t)
         -- subst-t -> stream-t (subst-t)
      -> stream-t (subst-t)

*** terms and substitutions

    - in the most general form, a substitution is

    #+begin_src cicada
    subst-t : -- term-t -> term-t
    #+end_src

    - subst-t is obviously compose-able as function

    - we can see that
      it is indeed good to use function types
      to model our semantics

    - preorder struct of subst-t can be defined by
      - a is more general than b
        if there exist x
        such that a; x = b
      - there `;` is infix notation for function composition
      - note that eqv between functions is used
        to define this relation

    - the relation might be important
      - for defining most general unifier (MGU)
        as result of unification algorithm
      - and if we only want to show
        the most general subst-t to user
        as search results

    - for simple function type like subst-t
      it is easy to see how to struct-lize it
      to dict-t (var-t term-t)
      and use deep-walk as subst-t apply to term-t

    - but for complicated function type like goal-t above
      the solution is not obvious

*** unification algorithm

    - with the abstract definition of subst-t and unify
      we can formalize other semantics of our language
      such as sub-type and type-check more easily

    #+begin_src cicada
    unify : -- u : term-t v : term-t -> s : subst-t
    such-that {
      check-same (term-t) (s (u) s (v))
    }
    #+end_src

    - u and v in `unify` is called equation
      or we can say :

    #+begin_src cicada
    equation-t = * (term-t term-t)
    #+end_src

    - solution preserving translation on equations
      - decomposition
      - variable elimination

    - unification algorithm
      is based on solution preserving translation
      most general unifier (MGU) should be the result

*** [note] unify in searching v.s. unify in checking

    #+begin_src cicada
    // unify in searching
    unify : -- term-t term-t -> subst-t
    // unify in checking
    unify : -- term-t term-t -> result-t (subst-t error-t)
    // because we need to do error report to user
    #+end_src

*** prolog

***** [todo] datatype

      #+begin_src cicada
      relation-t = ?

      // in a mexp syntax
      list-append-t:zero (null-c succ succ)
      list-append-t:succ (
        cons-c (car cdr)
        succ
        cons-c (car result-cdr)
      ) {
        list-append-t (cdr succ result-cdr)
      }
      #+end_src

***** interface

      #+begin_src cicada
      query : -- list-t (relation-t) -> stream-t (subst-t)

      query ([
        list-append-t (x y z)
      ])
      #+end_src

***** low level semantics

      - when try to implement prolog by a machine
        the machinery meens much like that of a parsing machine

      - without backtracking
        during a query
        the car relation-t of list-t (relation-t)
        can be stepped to
        tuple (list-t (relation-t) subst-t)
        where the list-t (relation-t) comes from
        the car relation-t's choices
        query ([A, B, C]) => query ([A1, A2, ..., B, C])

      - backtracking is needed
        when choices are made
        - x -
          so called "non-deterministic choices" which means
          choices will make the machine
          a non-deterministic automaton
          where non-deterministic means that the automaton
          does not need to do choices
          (beautiful tautology)

      - two non-deterministic choices are made
        in the process of querying
        1. one of an relation to rewrite
        2. among the potentially many rules
           whose head to unify with this relation

***** problem

      - prolog uses depth first searching
        which we should avoid
