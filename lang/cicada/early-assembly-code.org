* notation
  * "nature number" is just called "number"
* jo & jojo
  * use "jo" to denote bead
    and use "jojo" to denote a thread of beads
    [which reads like "珠珠" in Chinese]
* naming convention
  * a predicate of a type
    which denotes a subtype of that type
    uses that type as postfix
    such as
    "space-byte?"
  * a function of a type
    uses that type as prefix
    such as
    "string-reverse"
    "string-equal?"
  * side-effect of structured data is postfixed by "!"
* convention in assembly code
  * using underline to compose big word from small words
  * using "$" as prefix and postfix separator
  * indentation level = 3
  * naming convention of jo
    | convention   | jo type  |
    |--------------+----------|
    | prefix "V__" | variable |
  * but I use
    1. "zero" instead of "V__zero"
    2. "true" instead of "V__true"
* convention in cicada-nymph code
  * using dash to compose big word from small words
  * using "," as prefix and postfix separator
  * indentation style = free
  * words are separated by space
    except for bar-ket
    every bar-ket is viewed as a word
* syntax of cicada-nymph
  * table
    |----------------------+---------------------------|
    | syntax               | semantic                  |
    |----------------------+---------------------------|
    | word borderfix "* *" | variable                  |
    | word borderfix "+ +" | variable                  |
    | word borderfix ": :" | variable                  |
    | word postfix "!"     | some of the side-effect   |
    | word postfix "?"     | predicate                 |
    |----------------------+---------------------------|
    | bar-ket ( )          | not use                   |
    | bar-ket [ ]          | not use                   |
    | bar-ket { }          | not use                   |
    | double-quote         | viewed as special bar-ket |
    |                      | (bar is the same as ket)  |
    |                      | to support string literal |
    |----------------------+---------------------------|
  * but I use
    1. "true" instead of "*true*"
    2. "false" instead of "*false*"
* unique id
  * if one wish to get a named unique id
    a jo maybe used
    for a jo is an address in memory
    it is unique as a memory address
  * but there is not effort made
    to distinguish address and fixnum
    as different type of things
    thus
    this kind of unique id is not fit
    for some tasks
