记得我还在莫斯科大学上学的时候，
「数学基础 / Foundations of mathematics」
是一个特别不流行的学科。

当时有很多小组，
代数学小组，拓扑学小组，
分析学小组，微分方程小组……
当然也有一个数学基础小组。

在第二学年结束的时候，每位同学都必须选择他或她想去的小组。
这是一个重要的选择，我们经常讨论该去哪个小组，每个小组都有各自的名声。

在我那个时候，代数学小组非常酷，有很多名人在里面。
拓扑学与几何学的小组也很酷，也有很多名人在里面。

有一些小组就不是那么酷了，而其中最不酷的就数数学基础小组了。
（也许仅次于数学历史小组吧。）

没有哪个认为自己是位优秀数学家的人，会考虑去那里。

当时我去了代数学小组，到如今我还认为自己是一个代数学家，
我在把代数学的方法应用到数学的其它领域。

但是现在，我把所有的时间都投入到了而数学基础的工作中。

为什么？

为什么我会这样？

我变不酷了吗？

我来这儿，就是为了解释解释，为什么我们发展数学基础的方式，会让它重新变得非常酷。
（我之所以说「重新」，是因为在 1910 和 1920 年代，它曾是非常酷的学科。）

我们很多人做数学就有点儿像是拼魔方。

但是，让我获得 2002 年北京的菲尔兹奖的数学，却并非如此。

（菲尔兹奖版给我，是因为我证明了 [Milnor 猜想](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnor_conjecture)。）

------

假设你想要解某个五次代数方程。
通过某些方法，你找到了方程的解，
然后你可以把根带入方程中，来检查解是否正确。

但是当你想要解一个有二十个二十次方程的方程组时，
或者想要解类似复杂的问题。
通过某些方法，你找到了方程的解，
但是此时想要检查解的正确性，就需要做很多计算了。

如今没人会想用纸和笔来徒手做这类计算了，
你会用到某些软件来帮助自己做验证。

再设想，你的问题是要证明某个定理。
你找到的解是一个证明。
如何验证证明是否正确呢？

关于什么才是严格的证明，你从老师或教授那里，学到了一些惯例与原则，
但是你还不能把你的证明提供给计算机，让计算机去帮你检查它。

------

回到 Milnor 猜想。

问题是找到这个猜想的证明。

找这个解答花了我两年的时间，从 1993 年到 to 1995 年。

解答是一个证明。

1995 年，我开始着手「把证明写下来」。
1995 年六月的时候，我完成了第一个预印本。

- 译者注：「预印本 / Preprint」是数学论文发表之前，分发给同事和朋友看的版本。

但是，对我的 Milnor 猜想证明而言，这只是故事的开始。

你可以看到，真正的数学工作是如何随着时间演进而慢慢展开的。
理想情况下，就是「数学家证明定理」，但是你将看到真实情况是如何。

别忘了，我找到证明是在 1995 年，而我得菲尔兹奖是在 2002 年。

------

我找到的证明依赖于另一个猜想。
这个猜想本身也很酷，它连接了数学的两个领域，
这两个领域在当时看似还是远远分离的。

我也确信，我知道如何证明这个猜想，但是我知道要花很长时间。

然后，我开始想办法修改我的第一个证明，
让它能不依赖这个额外的猜想。
大约一年之后，我找到了办法。
我在 1996 年十二月写出了新的证明的预印本。
这个预印本中的证明，包含了所有的主要想法，
但是略去了很多细节。

之后，我花了七年的时间去补充这些细节，
以发表一个完整证明的论文……

------

我很幸运！

这个证明所依赖的想法，最终都证明是可靠的，
而且我所依赖的他人的工作成果，最终也都证明是正确的。

情况并非总是如此如愿。

我来讲讲我的另一个证明的故事，它的结果非常不同。

------

1987 我认识了 Mikhail Kapranov。
我那时是莫斯科大学的本科生，他是研究生。

我们马上就发现，我们都梦想着发展一种新的，
受高阶范畴论启发的「高维」数学。

我们开始一起工作。
那真是很有趣的很。
和你可以向他学习的人一起做数学，
同时又一起发现着，对你、对他、对整个世界来说，都是新的事物，
真是美妙而强有力的的经历。

------

1990 年夏天，经 Kapranov 的推荐，
我不用申请就被哈佛研究生院录取了。
1990 年秋天，我离开了苏联，开启了我生涯中在美国的时光……

------

Kapranov 和我写了一篇关于新的「高维」数学中关键猜想的论文。
这个猜想是 亚历山大·格罗滕迪克（Alexander Grothendieck）提出的。

> 直觉告诉我们，无穷阶广群（infinity-groupoids）
> 可以构成 同伦类型（homotopy types）的特别合适的模型，
> n-阶广群（n-groupoids）对应 截断同伦类型（truncated homotopy types）\
> （其中 `pi(i) = 0` 对所有 `i > n` 成立）。
>
> -- Esquisse d'un Programme 1984

- 译者注：法语 "Esquisse d'un Programme"，英译为 "Sketch of a Programme"，中译可作「计划概要」。
  是 格罗滕迪克 关于远期数学研究的重要提案，直到现在还是很多数学研究灵感的来源。

------

这个猜想并非表达地很精确，
因为如何定义 无穷阶广群（infinity-groupoid）还是公开的问题。

Kapranov 和我认为，我们知道定义是什么，
也知道该如何根据我们的定义来证明这个猜想。

我们写了一篇论文来描述证明的概要，
并且发表到了俄国最好的数学期刊之一，
完整的证明发表在了我们受邀参加的会议的会议记录中。

- 译者注：「会议记录 / The proceedings of a conference」也可称为「学报」，
  是学术界集会结束后发表的论文集，其中会包含演讲者的论文。

------

We felt that the issue with this conjecture is closed
and that this important element of "higher dimensional" mathematics had been understood.

Then in 2003, twelve years after our proof was published in English,
a preprint appeared on the web in which Carlos Simpson,
very politely, claimed that he has constructed a counter-example to our theorem.

I was busy with the work on the motivic program
and very sure that our proof is correct
and ignored the preprint.

------

Then the motivic period of my life was completed
and I started to work on computer proof verification
and new foundations of mathematics.

The correspondence between the infinity-groupoids and homotopy types
re-emerged as the cornerstone of the Univalent Foundations.

And then in the Fall of 2013,
some sort of a block in my mind collapsed
and I suddenly understood that Carlos Simpson was correct
and that the proof which Kapranov and I published in 1991 is wrong.

Not only the proof was wrong but the main theorem of that paper was false!.

------

In this story I got lucky again.

The theorem was false with the particular definition of infinity groupoids
which Kapranov and I have used.
There were by now various other definitions
with which the statement of the theorem became correct.

The use of the Grothendieck correspondence,
as it became known, in the Univalent Foundations
was not endangered.

But belief in the correctness of our false theorem
played an important and negative role
in how I perceived, for all these years, the subject area of multidimensional category theory.

- Because I believed in something which was false,
  I could not believe other things which were true,
  because they contradict each other.

  So I could not understand the work of others in this area.

------

When I recognized that the theorem of the paper is false
I contacted Kapranov to tell him that
we need to do something about the paper
and to tell Carlos Simpson that his preprint from 2003 is correct.

An interesting feature of this story is that
Carlos Simpson did not point out where in the proof,
which was about 10 pages long, the mistake was.
He only showed that it can not be correct
by building a counter-example to the final statement.

It took me several weeks to find which particular lemma in the paper is incorrect
and to find counterexamples to that lemma.

There no ending to this story yet.
The question that we originally wanted to answer
-- how to find an algebraic definition of infinity groupoids
that would satisfy the Grothendieck correspondence,
remains open...

------
Now let us look at this story again.
Kapranov and I have found a solution to the problem which we worked on
-- the proof of the theorem.

If the problem was to solve an equation
and we would have found a solution
we would have checked that it is a solution before publishing it, right?

And if it were a complex equation
we would probably have checked it on a computer.

So why can not we check a solution which is a proof of a theorem?

------

I started to ask myself this question more than 10 years ago
when the solutions, proofs, which I was inventing
were becoming more and more complex
and I was getting more and more worried that they may contain mistakes.

And trying to answer this question
led me to my current interest in Foundations of Mathematics.

Let me explain how.

------

A solution to an equation would probably be a number or a collection of numbers.

Verification in this case would consist in performing some computations with these numbers
and comparing the result of these computations with some other numbers.

But what should we do when the solution is a proof of a statement?

------

A hint can be seen from looking at the case
when the problem was to solve an equation in symbolic form.
For example, to find a formula for solving
a general equation of the form `x^3+a*x+b=0`.

How would we check the solution in this case?
We would probably use some software for symbolic computation
which can compute not only with numbers
but also with expressions which have variables in them.

So in order to check a solution which is a proof of a statement
we need to write both the statement and the proof as some kind of symbolic expressions
let's say `T` for the statement, and `A` for the proof,
and then use some software which can compute with these
expressions in such a way as to check that `A` is indeed a proof of `T`.

------

Encoding of statements and proofs
which exist in our thoughts
into symbolic expressions
is called **formalization**.

Formalization is, just like programming, first of all a tool
that we can use to pass on to computers
some of the mental tasks which we need to perform.

But at the moment it is much less developed than programming
and when I started to search, in 2003, for a formalization system
that I could use to help me check my proofs I could not find any.

I decided that I need to create such a system.

The first question to answer was
what was it that prevented the creation of such a system earlier?

------

What is involved in the creation of a formalization systems
for use in mathematics?

First of all we need to have a some knowledge
about how to design formal deduction systems
which are for formalization what programming languages are for programming.

The theory of formal deduction systems originated, as far as I could find, with
an amazing paper by Gottlob Frege from 1879 which is called
"A formula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought".

Today it is studied mainly in Computer Science "Theory B".

By the way, it is "Theory B"
not because it is less important than "Theory A"
but because of a Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science
which was published in two volumes "A" and "B"
and the theory of formal deduction systems was discussed in the second volume.

- The "Theory A", is much better known
  in many country of Asia, and in America, and in Israel.
  It is mostly concerned with complexity and algorithms.

  The "Theory B" is concerned with the theory and design of programming languages.

  The "B" here actually means it is more difficult,
  because more simple things are discussed in the first volume,
  and more complex things are discussed in the second volume.

------

But the theory of formal deduction systems
is only one part of what we need
to formalize mathematical statements and proofs.

This theory studies all possible formal deduction and computation systems.
Whether a given system formally represents some actual system of reasoning
which is used in the world of thought
is of no concern to this theory.

- It is like the theory of general differential equations,
  so it studies all differential equations,
  and does not care whether some differential equations
  describe some actual process in real world or not.

For proof verification we need to construct a **particular** formal deduction system
and explain how it corresponds with the mathematical objects
and forms of reasoning which exist in our thoughts.

------

Constructing such systems and correspondences between their formal components
and objects and actions in the world of our mathematical thoughts
is the main task of the field which is called Foundations of Mathematics.

- This is what Foundations of Mathematics is about,
  it is about connecting the world of our thoughts to objects in formal systems,
  which will help us to manipulate our thoughts.

A formal deduction system together with a correspondence
between its components and objects and actions in the world of mathematical thoughts
which can be used to formalize all subject areas of mathematics
is called a foundational system for mathematics or "Foundations of Mathematics".

- Of course this is not how "Foundations of Mathematics" is formulated
  back when I was in Moscow University.
  It was formulated very differently,
  if it was formulated like this,
  I will think it would be very very cool,
  but it was not.

  And this is how we look at it now.

------

I you have a system which can give you formulae
corresponding to your thoughts about numbers,
that would be a numbers system.

The earliest things like Foundations of Mathematics were the number systems,
these were the systems which allow people to write numbers,
which were objects of their simple mathematical thoughts.

They write numbers as symbols and to manipulate symbols
to compute practical things about numbers in the world.

For example, How to compute "How many bricks is needed to build a wall of some size".

That was mathematics at that time,
and the Foundations of Mathematics at that time is number systems.

Today mathematics is much wider.

And the Foundations of Mathematics,
is supposed to be some analog of number systems,
but for the mathematical objects which are much more abstract that we are dealing with today.

------

The mainstream foundation of classical pure mathematics
is called Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice or ZFC,
by the name of the axiomatic system of predicate logic which it uses.

- ZFC is a formal deduction system,
  In which the way to establish the correspondence between mathematical objects and our thoughts
  is called set theoretical mathematics.

  That is what the Bourbaki group did for many years in some areas of mathematics.

  It is a very beautiful foundation when you understand it.

It was created in the first decades of the 20th century before computers came into existence
and before the problem of formalization of actual complex proofs became relevant.

- Before there were computers, no one thought about actually formalizing complex proofs,
  because it was too difficult to do without computers.

In part because of it was designed to be used with mathematics of that time
it is not well adapted to the mathematics of the 21st century.
It is not well adapted to the task of computer proof verification.

To be able to check my proofs
as one can check solutions to equations
I needed new foundations of mathematics.

And this is how I became interested in foundations of mathematics ...

# Developments

Since then the story developed as follows.

I came up with the main ideas of Univalent Foundations in 2006.
Only one element was missing and it took me three years to find it.

In the Fall of 2009 I gave the first public lecture about the "univalent model"
-- a mathematical construction which connects Martin-Löf's Type Theory to ZFC
in a new, unexpected, way.

By the Spring of 2010 I have recognized that
I had a working version of a new formalization system
based on a new foundational system that I called Univalent Foundations.

In the academic year 2012/13, Thierry Coquand, Steve Awodey and myself
organized a special program at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton where I work.

------

During that year the participants of the program wrote, together, a book
called "Homotopy Type Theory".

Type these words in Google
and you will be directed to a website
where you can learn more about this new subject
and also download the book for free.


The book is a truly collective effort
and as such it does not have an author.
The person who did most to make this book happen
and who continues to shape the content and the style of the book
is Michael Schulman.

------

On June 21, 2014 Univalent Foundations passed another important milestone.
Thierry Coquand gave a talk about Univalent Foundations at the Bourbaki Seminar in Paris.
Being chosen for a presentation on this seminar
is widely considered to be an important symbol of recognition
in the world of pure mathematics.

Thierry and his colleagues are also the authors of the most important advance
in the mathematics of Univalent Foundations since their invention.
They have constructed another model,
similar to the original "univalent model" of 2009
but based on constructive mathematics.

This model opens up the way
for wider Univalent Synthesis of classical
and constructive mathematics ...

# After Notes

Such amazing stories as this one do not happen often.
But little boring stories of small mistakes happen all the time.

They were happening in my life

------

These small mistakes waste our time
and embarrass us when discovered by others.

As we get older and more established the fear of mistakes grows.
We spend more time re-checking our results and become less daring in trying new things.

------

As I said, I am lucky that I don’t have in my mathematical life
a story of a mistake which destroyed an important part of my work.

I know people who are not so lucky.

And as mathematics becomes more complex
the weight of mistakes of the fear of making a mistake
is slowing the development of mathematics more.

# Q&A

**Questioner** asked about the used of proof assistants.

**Voevodsky**: Proof assistants can be extremely useful,
just like musical instrument,
you can use it to practise,
in the circumstance where you do not have a teacher.

**Questioner** asked about how to improve "mathematical sense".

**Voevodsky**: By doing a lots and lots and lots detailed proofs and computations,
for hours and hours, and days and days, and month and month, and years.
trying to examine different areas of mathematics,
then it all some how connected in your head in some general view.

To use such "mathematical sense" to find new proofs,
When I was younger I would spending lots and lots of hours
writing things on paper, thinking and writing again,
and drinking a lot of strong tea,
walking around and rotating these things in my head over and over again.

As I become older I do not do this much, or at least I try not to.
And I usually try to just formulate a question very precisely,
to make sure it only has one meaning,
to place it in my head, to have it there firmly for sometime,
then I forget about it and do other things,
and I wait for the answer to come.
