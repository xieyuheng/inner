# The descriptive basis of mathematics

- Mathematics is that portion of our intellectual activity
  which transcends our biology and our environment.

  - The principles of biology as we know them
    may apply to life forms on other worlds,
    yet there is no necessity for this to be so.

  - The principles of physics should be more universal,
    yet it is easy to imagine another universe
    governed by different physical laws.

  Mathematics, a creation of mind,
  is less arbitrary than biology or physics,
  creations of nature;

  the creatures we imagine inhabiting another world
  in another universe,
  with another biology
  and another physics,
  will develop a mathematics
  which in essence is the same as ours.

  In believing this we may be falling into a trap:

  - Mathematics being a creation of our mind,
    it is, of course, difficult to imagine
    how mathematics could be otherwise
    without actually making it so,

  but perhaps we should not presume to predict
  the course of the mathematical activities
  of all possible types of intelligence.

  On the otherhand,
  the pragmatic content of our belief
  in the transcendence of mathematics
  has nothing to do with alien forms of life.
  Rather it serves to give a direction to mathematical investigation,
  resulting from the insistence that
  mathematics be born of an inner necessity.

- The primary concern of mathematics is number,
  and this means the positive integers.
  We feel about number the way Kant felt about space.

  The positive integers and their arithmetic are presupposed
  by the very nature of our intelligence and,
  we are tempted to believe,
  by the very nature of intelligence in general.

  The development of the theory of the positive integers
  from the primitive concept of the unit,
  the concept of adjoining a unit,
  and the process of mathematical induction
  carries complete conviction.

  In the words of Kronecker,
    the positive integers were created by God.
  Kronecker would have expressed it even better
  if he had said that
    the positive integers were created by God
    for the benefit of man
    (and other finite beings).

  Mathematics belongs to man, not to God.
  We are not interested in properties of the positive integers
  that have no descriptive meaning for finite man.
  When a man proves a positive integer to exist,
  he should show how to find it.
  If God has mathematics of his own that needs to be done,
  let him do it himself.

- Almost equal in importance to number
  are the constructions by which we ascend from number
  to the higher levels of mathematical existence.

  These constructions involve the discovery
  of relationships among mathematical entities already constructed,
  in the process of which new mathematical entities are created.

  The relations which form the point of departure are
  the order and arithmetical relations of the positive integers.

  From these we construct various rules
    for pairing integers with one another,
    for separating out certain integers from the rest,
    and for associating one integer to another.

  Rules of this sort
  give rise to the notions of sets and functions.

- A set is not an entity which has an ideal existence.
  A set exists only when it has been defined.
  To define a set we prescribe, at least implicitly,
  1. what we (the constructing intelligence) must do
     in order to construct an element of the set,
  2. and what we must do to show that
     two elements of the set are equal.

- A similar remark applies to the definition of a function:
  in order to define a function from a set A to a set B,
  1. we prescribe a finite routine
     which leads from an element of A to an elementof B,
  2. and show that
     equal elements of A
     give rise to
     equal elements of B.

- Building on the positive integers,
  weaving a web of ever more sets and more functions,
  we get the basic structures of mathematics:
    the rational number system,
    the real number system,
    the euclidean spaces,
    the complex number system,
    the algebraic number fields,
    Hilbert space,
    the classical groups,
    and so forth.

  Within the framework of these structures
  most mathematics is done.
  Everything attaches itself to number,
  and every mathematical statement
  ultimately expresses the fact that
    if we perform certain computations
    within the set of positive integers,
    we shall get certain results.

- mathematics takes another leap,
  from the entity which is constructed in fact
  to the entity whose construction is hypothetical.

  To some extent
  hypothetical entities are present from the start:
    whenever we assert that
    every positive integer has a certain property,
    in essence we are considering a positive integer
    whose construction is hypothetical.

  But now we become bolder and consider a hypothetical set,
  endowed with hypothetical operations
  subject to certain axioms.
  In this way we introduce such structures as
    topological spaces,
    groups,
    and manifolds.

  The motivation for doing this
  comes from the study of concretely constructed examples,
  and the justification
  comes from the possibility of
  applying the theory of the hypothetical structure
  to the study of more than one specific example.

  Recently it has become fashionable
  to take another leap
  and study, as it were,
  a hypothetical hypothetical structure
    a hypothetical structure qua hypothetical structure.

  Again the motivations and justifications
  attach themselves to particular examples,
  and the examples
  attach themselves to numbers in the ultimate analysis.
  Thus even the most abstract mathematical statement
  has a computational basis.

- The transcendence of mathematics demands that
  it should not be confined to computations that I can perform,
  or you can perform,
  or 100 men working 100 years
    with 100 digital computers can perform.
  Any computation that can be performed by a finite intelligence
    any computation that has a finite number of steps
  is permissible.

  This does not mean that
  no value is to be placed on the efficiency of a computation.
  An applied mathematician will prize a computation
  for its efficiency above all else,
  whereas in formal mathematics
  much attentionis paid to elegance
  and little to efficiency.

  Mathematics should and must concern itself with efficiency,
    perhaps to the detriment of elegance,
  but these matters will come to the fore
  only when realism has begun to prevail.
  Until then
  our first concern will be
  to put as much mathematics as possible
  on a realistic basis
  without close attention to questions of efficiency.

# The idealistic component of mathematics

- Geometry was highly idealistic
    from the time of Euclid and the ancients
    until the time of Descartes,
  unfolding from axioms
  taken either to be self-evident
  or to reflect properties of the real world.

  Descartes reduced geometry to the theory of the real numbers,
  and in the nineteenth century
  Dedekind, Weierstrass, and others,
  by the arithmetization of the real number system,
  brought space into the concrete realm of objects
  constructed by pure thought.

- Unfortunately
  the promise held out to mathematics
  by the arithmetization of space
  was not fulfilled,
  largely due to the intervention,
  around the turn of the century,
  of the formalist program.

  The successful formalization of mathematics
  helped keep mathematics on a wrong course.

  The fact that space has been arithmetized
  loses much of its significance
  if space, number, and everything else
  are fitted into a matrix of idealism
  where even the positive integers
  have an ambiguous computational existence.

  Mathematics becomes the game of sets,
  which is a fine game as far as it goes,
  with rules that are admirably precise.
  The game becomes its own justification,
  and the fact that it represents
  a highly idealized version of mathematical existence
  is universally ignored.

- Of course, idealistic tendencies have been present
  if not dominantin mathematics
  since the Greeks,
  but it took the full flowering of formalism
  to kill the insight into the nature of mathematics
  which its arithmetization could have given.

- To see how some of the most basic results of classical analysis
  lack computational meaning,
  take the assertion that
  - every bounded non-void set A of real numbers
    has a least upper bound.
    - The real number b is the least upper bound of A
      if a <= b
      for all a in A
      and if there exist elements of A
      that are arbitrarily close to b.

  To avoid unnecessary complications,
  we actually consider the somewhat less general assertion that
  - every bounded sequence {x(k)} of rational numbers
    has a least upper bound b
    (in the set of real numbers).

  If this assertion were constructively valid,
  we could compute b,
  in the sense of computing a rational number approximating b
  to within any desired accuracy;
  infact we could program a digital computer
  to compute the approximations for us.
  For instance,
  the computer could be programmed to produce, one by one,
  a sequence {(b(k), m(k))} of ordered pairs,
  where each b(k) is a rational number
  and each m(k) is a positive integer, such that
  1. x(j) <= b(k) + 1/k
     for all positive integers j and k,
  2. x(m(k)) >= b(k) - 1/k
     for all positive integers k.

  Unless there exists a general method M that
  produces such a computer program
  corresponding to each bounded
  constructively given sequence {x(k)} of rational numbers,
  we are not justified, by constructive standards,
  in asserting that each of the sequences {x(k)}
  has a least upper bound.

  To see the scope such a method M would have,
  consider a constructively given sequence {n(k)} of integers,
  each of which is either 0 or 1.
  Using the method M,
  we compute a rational number b(3)
  and a positive integer N = m(3) such that
  1. n(j) <= b(3) + 1/3
     for all positive integers j
  2. n(N) >= b(3) - 1/3

  Either n(N) = 0 or n(N) = 1
  If n(N) = 0
  then (1) and (2) imply that
    n(j) <= b(3) + 1/3 <= n(N) + 2/3 = 2/3
    for all j
  Since each n(j) is either 0 or 1,
  it follows that n(j) = 0, for all j.
  Thus,
  for each of the sequences {n(k)} being considered,
  the method M either
  1. produces a proof that
     the n(k) are all equal to 0,
  2. or produces a positive integer N
     such that n(N) = 1.
  Of course, such a method M does not exist,
  and nobody expects that one will ever be found.
  Such a method
  would solve most of the famous unsolved problems of mathematics
  Fermat's last theorem,
  the four-color problem,
  and the Riemann hypothesis, in particular,
  since each of these problems can be reduced to finding,
  for a certain sequence {n(k)} of the type being considered,
  either a proof that
    n(k) = 0 for all k
  or a proof that
    n(k) = 1 for some k.

- As another instance,
  consider the intuitively appealing theorem that
  - every continuous function f on the closed interval [0,1],
    for which f(0) < 0 and f(1) > 0,
    vanishes at some point x0.

  This theorem can be derived from the least-upper-bound principle:
  take x0 to be the least upper bound
  of the set of all x for which f(x) < 0.

  The fact that we make use of the least-upper-bound principle
  does not mean our theorem is unconstructive;
  it only means the given proof is unconstructive.

  A closer examination demonstrates that
  our theorem itself is unconstructive.
  This demonstration, which we now give,
  uses facts from the constructive theory of continuous functions,
  with which the reader is probably not familiar.
  Nevertheless, it should provide some insight.
  Let {n(k)} be any constructively given sequence of integers,
  each of which is either -1, 0, or 1.
  Define the real number a by
    a = SUM 3^-k * n(k)
        where k from 1 to positive-infinity
  There exists a unique constructively given continuous
  function f on [0,1] such that
    f(0) = -1
    f(1) = 1
    f(1/3) = f(2/3) = a
  and f is linear on each of the intervals
    [0,1/3]
    [1/3,2/3]
    [2/3,1]
  If our theorem is valid,
  there exists a point x0 with f(x0) = 0.
    By computing a sufficiently close
    rational approximation to x0,
  we show that either
  1. x0 < 2/3
  2. x0 > 1/3
  In the first case, a >= 0,
  and therefore
  the first nonzero term of the sequence {n(k)},
  if one exists, equals 1.
  Similarly, in the second case,
  the first nonzero term,
  if one exists, equals -1.
  Thus our theorem gives a method,
  for each of the sequences {n(k)} being considered,
  of either
  1. proving that any term that equals 1
     is preceded by a term that equals -1,
  2. proving that any term that equals -1
     is preceded by a term that equals 1.
  Nobody believes that such a method will ever be found.

- Brouwer fought the advance of formalism
  and undertook the disengagement of mathematics from logic.
  He wanted to strengthen mathematics by
    associating to every theorem and every proof
    a pragmatically meaningful interpretation.

  His program failed to gain support.

  He was an indifferent expositor and an inflexible advocate,
  contending against the great prestige of Hilbert
  and the undeniable fact that
  idealistic mathematics produced the most general results
  with the least effort.

  More important,
  Brouwer's system itself had traces of idealism
  and, worse, of metaphysical speculation.
  There was a preoccupation
  with the philosophical aspects of constructivism
  at the expense of concrete mathematical activity.

  A calculus of negation was developed
  which became a crutch
  to avoid the necessity of getting precise constructive results.
  It is not surprising that
  some of Brouwer's precepts were then formalized,
  giving rise to so-called intuitionistic number theory,
  and that the formal system so obtained
  turned out not to be of any constructive value.

  In fairness to Brouwer
  it should be said that
  he did not associate himself with these efforts
  to formalize reality;
  it is the fault of the logicians that
  many mathematicians who think they know something of the constructive point of view
  have in mind a dinky formal system
  or, just as bad,
  confuse constructivism with recursive function theory.

- Brouwer became involved in metaphysical speculation
  by his desire to improve the theory of the continuum.
  A bugaboo of both Brouwer and the logicians
  has been compulsive speculation
  about the nature of the continuum.

  In the case of the logicians this leads to contortions
  in which various formal systems,
  all detached from reality,
  are interpreted within one another
  in the hope that
  the nature of the continuum will somehow emerge.

  In Brouwer's case
  there seems to have been a nagging suspicion that
  unless he personally intervened to prevent it
  the continuum would turn out to be discrete.
  He therefore introduced the method of free-choice sequences
  for constructing the continuum,
  as a consequence of which the continuum cannot be discrete
  because it is not well enough defined.
  This makes mathematics so bizarre
  it becomes unpalatable to mathematicians,
  and foredooms the whole of Brouwer's program.
  This is a pity,
  because Brouwer had a remarkable insight
  into the defects of classical mathematics,
  and he made a heroic attempt to set things right.

# The constructivization of mathematics

- A set is defined
  by describing exactly what must be done
  in order to construct an element of the set
  and what must be done in order to show that
  two elements are equal.

  There is no guarantee that
  the description will be understood;
  it may be that
  an author thinks he has described a set with sufficient clarity
  but a reader does not understand.

  As an illustration
  consider the set of all sequences {n(k)} of integers.
  To construct such a sequence
  we must give a rule
  which associates an integer n(k)
  to each positive integer k in such a way that
  for each value of k
  the associated integer n(k) can be determined
    in a finite number of steps
    by an entirely routine process.

  Now this definition could perhaps be interpreted
  to admit sequences {n(k)}
  in which n(k) is constructed by a search,
  the proof that the search actually produces a value of n(k)
  after a finite number of steps
  being given in some formal system.

  Of course, we do not have this interpretation in mind,
  but it is impossible
  to consider every possible interpretation of our definition
  and say whether that is what we have in mind.

  There is always ambiguity,
  but it becomes less and less as the reader continues to read
  and discovers more and more of the author's intent,
  modifying his interpretations if necessary
  to fit the intentions of the author
  as they continue to unfold.

  At any stage of the exposition
  the reader should be content
  if he can give a reasonable interpretation
  to account for everything the author has said.

  The expositor himself
  can never fully know all the possible ramifications of his definitions,
  and he is subject to the same necessity of modifying his interpretations,
  and sometimes his definitions as well,
  to conform to the dictates of experience.

- The constructive interpretations
  of the mathematical connectives and quantifiers
  have been established by Brouwer.

- To prove the statement (P and Q)
  we must prove the statement P and prove the statement Q,
  just as in classical mathematics.

- To provethe statement (P or Q)
  we must either prove the statement P or prove the statement Q,
  whereas in classical mathematics
  it is possible to prove (P or Q) without proving either the statement P or the statement Q.

- The connective 'implies' is more complicated.
  To prove (P implies Q)
  we must show that P necessarily entails Q,
  or that Q is true whenever P is true.
  The validity of the computational facts implicit in the statement P
  must insure the validity of the computational facts implicitin the statement Q,
  but the way this actually happens can only be seen
  by looking at the proof of the statement (P implies Q).
  Statements formed with this connective,
  for example, statements of the type ((P implies Q) implies R),
  have a less immediate meaning than the statements from which they are formed,
  although in actual practice
  this does not seem to lead to difficulties in interpretation.

- The negation (not P) of a statement P
  is the statement (P implies 0 = 1).
  Classical mathematics makes no distinction
  between the content of the statements P and not (not P),
  whereas constructively
  the latter is a weaker statement.

- Brouwer's system makes essential use of negation in defining,
  for instance, inequality and set complementation.
  Thus two elements of a set A are unequal
    according to Brouwer
  if the assumption of their equality
  somehow allows us to compute that 0 = 1.

  It is natural to want to replace this negativistic definition
  by something more affirmative,
  phrased as much as possible
  in terms of specific computations
  leading to specific results.

  Brouwer himself does just this for the real number system,
  introducing an affirmative and stronger relation of inequality
  in addition to the negativistic relation already defined.
  Experience shows that it is not necessary to define inequality in terms of negation.
  For those cases in which an inequality relation is needed,
  it is better to introduce it affirmatively.
  The same remarks apply to set complementation.

- Van Dantzig and others have gone as far as to propose that
  negation could be entirely avoided in constructive mathematics.
  Experience bears this out.
  In many cases where we seem to be using negation
  for instance, in the assertion that
    either a given integer is even or it is no
  we are really asserting that
  one of two finitely distinguishable alternatives actually obtains.

  Without intending to establish a dogma,
  we may continue to employ the language of negation
  but reserve it for situations of this sort,
  at least until experience changes our minds,
  and for counterexamples and purposes of motivation.

  This will have the advantage of making mathematics more immediate
  and in certain situations forcing us to sharpen our results.

- Proofs by contradiction
  are constructively justified in finite situations.

  When we have proved that
  one of finitely many alternatives holds at a certain stage in the proof of a theorem,
  to finish the proof of the theorem it is enough to show that
  the theorem is a consequence of each of the alternatives.
  Should one of the alternatives lead to a contradiction,
  that is, imply 0 = 1,
  we may either say that the alternative in question is ruled out
  and pass on to the consideration of the other alternatives,
  or we may be more meticulous
  and prove that the theorem is a consequence of the equality 0 = 1.

- A universal statement,
  to the effect that
  every element of a certain set A has a certain property P,
  has the same meaning in constructive as in classical mathematics.
  To prove such a statement
  we must show by some general argument that
  if x is any element of A,
  then x has property P.

- Constructive existence
  is much more restrictive
  than the ideal existence of classical mathematics.

  The only way to show that an object exists
  is to give a finite routine for finding it,
  whereas in classical mathematics
  other methods can be used.
  In fact the following principle is valid in classical mathematics:
    Either all elements of A have property P
    or there exists an element of A with property (not P).
  This principle,
  which we shall call the principle of omniscience,
  lies at the root of most of the unconstructivities of classical mathematics.
  This is already true of the principle of omniscience in its simplest form:
    if {n(k)} is a sequence of integers,
    then either n(k) = 0 for some k
    or n(k) =/= 0 for all k.
  We shall call this the limited principle of omniscience.
  Theorem after theorem of classical mathematics
  depends in an essential way on the limited principle of omniscience,
  and is therefore not constructively valid.

  Some instances of this are the theorem that
  - a continuous real valued function
    on a closed bounded interval
    attains its maximum,
  - the fixed-point theorem
    for a continuous map of a closed cell into itself,
  - the ergodictheorem,
  - and the Hahn-Banach theorem.

  Nevertheless these theorems are not lost to constructive mathematics.
  Each of these theorems P has a constructive substitute Q,
  which is a constructively valid theorem
  Q implying P in the classical system
  by a more or less simple argument
  based on the limited principle of omniscience.
  For instance,
  the statement that
    every continuous function from a closed cell in euclidean space
    into itself admits a fixed point
  finds a constructive substitute in the statement that
    such a function admits a point
    which is arbitrarily near to its image.

- The extent
  to which good constructive substitutes exist for the theorems of classical mathematics
  can be regarded as a demonstration that
  classical mathematics has a substantial underpinning of constructive truth.

- When a classical mathematician claims he is a constructivist,
  he probably means he avoids the axiom of choice.
  This axiom is unique in its ability to trouble the conscience of the classical mathematician,
  but in fact it is not a real source of the unconstructivities of classical mathematics.
  A choice function exists in constructive mathematics,
  because a choice is implied by the very meaning of existence.

  Applications of the axiom of choice in classical mathematics
  either are irrelevant
  or are combined with a sweeping appeal to the principle of omniscience.
  The axiom of choice is used to extract elements from equivalence classes
  where they should never have been put in the first place.
  For instance,
  a real number should not be defined
  as an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers;
  there is no need to drag in the equivalence classes.
  The proof that the real numbers can be well ordered
  is an instance of a proof in which a sweeping use of the principle of omniscience
  is combined with an appeal to the axiom of choice.
  Such proofs offer little hope of constructivization.
  It is not likely that the theorem
    the real numbers can be well ordered
  will be given a constructive version
  consonant with the intuitive interpretation of the classical result.

- Almost every conceivable type of resistance has been offered
  to a straightforward realistic treatment of mathematics,
  even by constructivists.

  Brouwer, who has done more for constructive mathematics than anyone else,
  thought it necessary to introduce a revolutionary, semimystical theory of the continuum.

  Weyl, a great mathematician who in practice suppressed his constructivist convictions,
  expressed the opinion that idealistic mathematics finds its justification in its applications to physics.

  Hilbert, who insisted on constructivity in meta-mathematics
  but believed the price of a constructive mathematics was too great,
  was willing to settle for consistency.

  Brouwer's disciples
  joined forces with the logicians
  in attempts to formalize constructive mathematics.

  Others seek constructive truth in the framework of recursive function theory.

  Still others look for a short cut to reality,
  a point of vantage
  which will suddenly reveal classical mathematics in a constructive light.
  None of these substitutes for a straightforward realistic approach has worked.
  It is no exaggeration to say that
  a straightforward realistic approach to mathematics has yet to be tried.
  It is time to make the attempt.
