- recursion
- mathematical induction

10 mental models for learning:

- problem solving is search

  - herbert simon
  - constraint propagation

- memory strengthens by retrieval

  - testing

- knowledge grows exponentially

  - postive feed back loop
  - knowledge tree and foundation
  - set theory and basic equivalence

- creativity is mostly copying

  - evalution and mutation of ideas

- skills are specific

  - possibility of transferring knowledge across domains
  - the breadth one's knowledge

- mental bandwidth is extremely limited

  - focus
  - cognitive load
  - learn by working examples

- success is the best teacher

  - solution space is large and most solutions are wrong

- we reason through examples

  - logic (cause and effect) is based on models
  - model theory of logic
  - the book of why

- knowledge becomes invisible with experience

  - learn by teaching

- relearning is relatively fast

  - forgetting is ok
  - take good notes
  - first time learning is hard
