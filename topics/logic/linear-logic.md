# References

- Girard, Lafont, and Taylor, "Proofs and types"

  is a book evolved from lecture notes of a graduate course of the same title.
  It is a good reference for an introduction to the proof-program correspondence,
  although it does not cover all topics of the matter.

- Girard, "Linear Logic"

  is the historical paper introducing linear logic.
  It is an unavoidable reference, although not the best way
  to discover the topic nowadays, since many aspects have been better understood since then.

- Girard, "Linear Logic: Its Syntax and Semantics"

  is an updated and more accessible presentation, written about ten years later.
