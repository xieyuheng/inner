# Xie: Notes

- The key of statistics is

  1. to view frequency as probability
  2. and to do hypothesis test
     - suppose H is true, what is the probability that
       we observe what we observed

- Statistics is easy to be abused,
  we need to study the history of it.

# Introduction to Statistics

- In statistics, if we do one study on a sample,
  we can not make judgment without uncertainty,
  but we still want to say something.

  Observing that 78% patients were cured,
  we want to say something about other studies of the same drug,
  the effectiveness shown in other studies will be around 78%
  but uncertainty, we give a range, say from 70% to 86%,
  and we still are not certainty about our judgment about the range,
  so we say our confidence about our judgment is 95%.

- When you make conclusions based on data (one study),
  those conclusions might be erroneous (with uncertainty).

- Determine sample size.
