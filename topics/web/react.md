title: React

# Why?

In work I have to use React.js which is really inferior to Vue.js,
but I do not have the power to change the team's choice.

# MobX for MVVM

We can use MobX for MVVM in React.

# Hooks

Comparing to MVVM, maybe hooks are
better for composition of reactive state,
because we can not compose view models.
