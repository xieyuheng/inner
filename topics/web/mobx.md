title: MobX
---

- TODO We need a clear understand of why React requires hand optimizations.

  - Maybe we should implement a mini React first:
    https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp
    - Which might help me to appreciate the contribution of React.
    - Also note that, with a mini MobX and a mini React,
      we have a mini MVVM framework.

# MVVM

- clear dependency boundary,
  thus easy to understand,
  thus easy to change.

- possible to test,
  we can test the interface of a feature (the view model),
  not the detailed implementation of a feature (the dom tree).

- easy to do further refactorings.

- easy to refactor into (little by little).

- optimal rendering,
  no need to think about optimising it at all.

- bast practice,
  MVVM is used by Windows, IOS, Android,
  and Vue, Angular, Svelte, Ember, Alpine, ...
  almost all other frontend web framework.

- easy to refactor component into subcomponents,
  because they have the same context.

- clear boundary of re-rendering -- component.

- feels like spreadsheet

  Three core concepts:

  - `State` (`observable`)
  - `Action`
  - `Derivation` (`computed` and `Reaction`)

  In a reactive class:

  - data field -- `observable`
  - getter, query -- `computed`
  - mutation -- `Action`

  Note that `Reaction` are not defined in the class.

  > State is the data that drives your application. Usually, there is
  > domain specific state like a list of todo items, and there is view
  > state, such as the currently selected element. State is like
  > _spreadsheet cells_ that hold a value.
  >
  > Using `observable` is like turning a property of an object into a
  > _spreadsheet cell_. But unlike spreadsheets, these values can not
  > only be primitive values, but also references, objects and arrays.
  >
  > An action is any piece of code that changes the state. User
  > events, backend data pushes, scheduled events, etc. An action is
  > like a user that enters a new value into a spreadsheet cell.
  >
  > These computations [in computed methods] resemble formulas in
  > spreadsheet programs like MS Excel. They update automatically,
  > but only when required. That is, if something is interested in
  > their outcome.
