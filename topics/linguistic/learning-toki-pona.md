# numbers

The simple reality is that having words
for every possible number is already a losing battle
By their very nature
numbers are infinite
Name any number; a higher one exists
*The higher and more precise you want to go*
*the more abstract and disconnected*
*from the present moment it becomes*

ala	zero is the absence of something, meaning no.
wan	one
tu	two
mute	several, many
ale	all, infinite, also any overwhelmingly large number
luka  which normally means "hand", can also be used for the number 5


Word order
Model: noun + number
Place the number word after the thing you're counting.

sike tu	two balls
sike mute	seven balls
mi	I, we
mi wan	I (but not we)
mi mute	we (but not I)

Other words are treated the same way

# lon, kepeken, tawa

three words can be used as both
a verb and a preposition

## lon

to be in/at/on
to exist
in, at, on

"mi lon tomo"
"mi moku lon tomo"
"suno li lon sewi"

### using lon with "wile"

"mi wile lon tomo"
= "I want to be at home"
OR "I want (to do something) in a house"

"mi wile e ni: mi lon tomo"
= "I want this: I'm at home"

*e ni:*
"sina toki e ni tawa mi: sina moku"
= "You told me that you are eating"

### using lon as an action verb

lape (sleep)
pini (stop, end)

"mi pini e lape sina"
= "I end a sleeping-you"
OR "I woke you up"

"mi lon e sina"
= "I made you aware of reality"
= "I forced you to be to present and alert"
OR "I woke you up"

*NOTE*
you could not say "sina lon e mi"
"mi lon e sina" only works because
to the waker
it seems as if the sleeper is not present
in the waker's reality
the sleeper seems absent
and so waking him up brings him into
the waker's reality

## kepeken

to use
with, using

### as an action verb

"mi kepeken e ilo"
=  "I'm using tools"

"sina wile kepeken e ilo"
= "You have to use tools"

"mi kepeken e poki ni"
= "I'm using that cup"

### as a preposition

"mi moku kepeken ilo moku"
= "I eat using a fork/spoon/any type of eating utensil."

"mi lukin kepeken ilo suno"
= "I look using a flashlight"
(ilo suno = a tool of light, hence flashlight)

## tawa

to go to, to move
to, for

### as a verb

"mi tawa tomo mi"

"ona mute li tawa utala"

"sina wile tawa telo suli"

"ona li tawa sewi kiwen"
= "She's going to the top (of) the rock"

The reason that lon and tawa don't have an "e" after them is that
there is no object
For example
in the sentence "I'm going to my house"
the speaker simply went home
He did not do anything to his house
he just went to it
If he had burned the house down
or had tried to do something to it
or affect it in some way
then "e" would come after the verb
Otherwise, no "e"

### using tawa to mean "to"

"mi toki tawa sina"
= "I talk to you"

"ona li lawa e jan tawa ma pona"
= "He led people to the good land"

"ona li kama tawa ma mi"
= "He's coming to my country"

*to say you like something*
"ni li pona tawa mi"
= "That is good to me"
(or, in other words, "I like that.")

"ni li ike tawa mi"

"kili li pona tawa mi"

"toki li pona tawa mi"
= "I like talking"
OR "I like languages"

Keep in mind that "e" can only come after the verb of the sentence
Toki Pona does not use clauses
So for example
if you wanted to say "I like watching the countryside"
you could NOT say something like this:
"lukin e ma li pona tawa mi"
It's best to split this into two sentences:
"mi lukin e ma. ni li pona tawa mi"
= "I'm watching the countryside. This is good to me."
Of course, you could choose to say this same sentence
using other techniques
we learned in chapter five:
"ma li pona lukin"
= "The countryside is good visually. The countryside is good to look at."

### using tawa to mean "for"

"mi pona e tomo tawa jan pakala"
= "I fixed the house for the disabled man"

### using tawa as an adjective

"tomo tawa"
= "car"
(a more literal translation is "moving construction")

"tomo tawa telo"
= "boat, ship"

"tomo tawa kon"
= "airplane, helicopter"

### ambiguity of tawa

"mi pana e tomo tawa sina"

### tawa as an action verb

"mi tawa e kiwen"
= "I'm moving the rock"

"ona li tawa e len mi"
= "She moved my clothes"

## and kama

### used with tawa

"ona li kama tawa tomo mi"
= "He came to my house"

### as "to cause" or "to bring about"

"mi kama e pakala"
= "I caused an accident"

"sina kama e ni: mi wile moku"
= "You caused this: I want to eat"

so one always split a sentence into two
but not using clauses

### It can also be used with infinitives

to make a progressive-like effect

"mi kama jo e telo"
= "I came to have the water"
= "I got the water"

## TRY

I fixed the flashlight using a small tool
=
mi pona e ilo suno kepeken ilo lili

i like toki pona
=
toki pona li pona tawa mi

We gave them food
=
mi mute li pana e moku tawa ona mute

This is for my friend
=
ni li tawa jan pona mi

The tools are in the container
=
ilo li lon poki

That bottle is in the dirt
=
poki ni li lon jaki

I want to go to his house using my car
=
mi wile tawa tomo ona kepeken tomo tawa mi

They are arguing
=
ona mute li utala toki

sina wile kama tawa tomo toki
=
you should come to the chat room

jan li toki kepeken toki pona lon tomo toki
=
people chat in toki pona in the chat room

mi tawa tomo toki. ona li pona tawa mi
=
i have be the chat room. i like it.

sina kama jo e jan pona lon ni
=
you will get friends there

# other prepositions

## sewi, anpa, insa, monsi

"ona li lon sewi mi"
= "He is in my above"

"pipi li lon anpa mi"
= "The bug is underneath me"

"moku li lon insa mi"
= "Food is inside me"

"len li lon monsi mi"
= "Clothes are behind me"

Although you might be tempted to use these words
as prepositions
they are actually nouns
You have to use another preposition along with
these words
and "mi" is a possessive pronoun meaning "my"
So "sewi mi" means something like "my above"
or "the area that is above me"
And since these words are merely nouns
you must still have a verb
in the above examples
"lon" is acting as the verb
Don't forget to include a verb!

Since these words aren't prepositions
they are free for other uses
just like any other noun/adjective/verb:
*monsi as a body part*
monsi can mean either the back or the butt
*anpa as a verb*
"mi anpa e jan utala"
= "I defeated the warrior"

## sama

"jan ni li sama mi"
= "That person is like me"

"ona li lukin sama pipi"
= "He looks like a bug"

"sama li ike"
= "Equality is bad"

## tan

"mi moku tan ni: mi wile moku"
= "I eat because-of this: I want to-eat"

## poka

### as a noun/adjective

"ona li lon poka mi"
= "He is at my side. He is beside me"

"jan poka"
= "neighbor; someone who is beside you"

"poka telo"
= "water side"
= "the beach"

### as a preposition

"mi moku poka jan pona mi"
= "I ate beside my friend"

"mi moku lon poka pi jan pona mi"
= "I ate at side of my friend"

"mi utala e jan ike poka jan nasa"
= "I fought an enemy with a drunk guy"

"mi utala e jan ike lon poka pi jan nasa"
= "I fought an enemy at the side of a drunk guy"

in every sentence there is a main verb
and other prepositions in that sentence
is about the main verb

## TRY

My friend is beside me
=
jan pona mi li lon poka mi

The sun is above me
=
sonu li lon sewi mi

The land is beneath me
=
ma li lon anpa mi

Bad things are behind me
=
ijo ike li lon monsi mi

I'm okay because I'm alive
=
mi pona tan ni: mi lon

I look at the land beside my friend
=
mi lukin e ni: ma poka jan pona mi
(the poka is about lukin)
mi lukin e ma poka jan pona mi
(is the poka is about lukin?)
mi lukin e ma lon poka pi jan pona mi
(is the lon is about lukin?)

People look like ants
=
jan li lukin sama pipi

poka mi li pakala
=
My hip hurts

mi kepeken e poki e ilo moku
=
i'm using a bowl and a spoon

jan li lon insa tomo
=
Somebody is inside the house

# negation yes/no questions

## negation

"mi lape ala"
= "I'm not sleeping"
(literally: "I sleep not.")

"mi musi ala"
= "I'm not having fun"

"mi wawa ala"
= "I'm not strong"

"mi wile ala tawa musi"
= "I don't want to dance"
("tawa musi" = "move entertainingly")

"jan ala li toki"
= "Nobody is talking"

like "nicht" in Deutsch
bu in the end of something

*NOTE*
Incorrect:
"ijo ala li jaki"

Correct:
"ala li jaki"
= "Nothing is dirty"


for
"ijo li ..."
= "∃x∈A: ..."
(where A is depended by the context)

"<set:A> ala li ..."
= "∀x∈A: ¬ ..."

so ijo is not a set which ala can deny

## ale and ali

despite the differences in meaning
ala and ale / ali
as adjectives are used the same way

The word ali has been created fairly recently
Before it, there was only ale
ale and ala are very close in pronunciation
so we create ali


"jan ali li wile tawa"
= "Everybody wants to travel"

"ma ali li pona"
= "All nations are good"

Also like ala
it's best not to use ijo and ali together:
Incorrect:
"ijo ali li pona"

for
"<set:A> ali li ..."
= "∀x∈A: ..."

By the way
"ali li pona"
is one of the Toki Pona proverbs
if you didn't know that

## yes/no questions

"sina pona ala pona?"
just like Chinese

"suno li suli ala suli?"
= "Is the sun big?"

"len sina li telo ala telo?"
= "Are your clothes wet?"

"tomo tawa sina li pakala ala pakala?"
= "Is your car messed up?"

"sina ken ala ken lape?"
= "Can you sleep?"

"ona li lon ala lon tomo?"
= "Is he in the house?"

"ona li tawa ala tawa ma ike?"
= "Did he go to the evil land?"

"sina pana ala pana e moku tawa jan lili?"
= "Did you give food to the child?"

"pipi li moku ala moku e kili?"
= "Are the bugs eating the fruit?"


wile -- Yes
wile ala -- No

lukin -- Yes
lukin ala -- No

"sina sona ala sona e toki mi?"
= "Do you understand my talking? "
sona -- Yes
sona ala -- No

## tan as a noun

"mi sona ala e tan"
= "I don't know the reason"

## TRY

"Is that funny? Yes."
=
"ni li musi ala musi? musi"

"You have to tell me why"
=
"sina wile toki e tan tawa mi"

"Is a bug beside me?"
=
"pipi li lon ala lon poka mi?"

"Do you like me?"
=
"mi pona ala pona tawa sina?"

" I can't sleep"
=
"mi ken ala lape"

"I don't want to talk to you"
=
"mi wile ala toki tawa sina"

"He didn't go to the lake"
=
"ona li tawa ala telo"

"sina wile ala wile pali? wile ala"
=
"Do you want to work? no"

"jan utala li seli ala seli e tomo?"
=
"Is the warrior burning the huose?"

"jan lili li ken ala moku e telo nasa"

"sina kepeken ala kepeken e ni?"
=
"Are you using that?"

"sina ken ala ken kama?"
=
"Are you coming?"

# gender, unofficial words, addressing people, interjections, commands

## gender

"mama meli"
= "mother"

"mama mije"
= "father"

Specifying male or female is often unnecessary
so why bother?

## unofficial words

## addressing people, commands, interjections

### interjections

toki = hello
pona! = Yay!
ike! = Oh no! Alas!
pakala = funk!
mu = sounds made by animals

suno pona! -- Good sun!
lape pona! -- Sleep well! Have a good night!
moku pona! -- Good food! Enjoy your meal!
mi tawa -- I'm going. Bye!
tawa pona! -- (in reply) Go well! Good bye!
kama pona! -- Come well! Welcome!
musi pona! -- Good fun! Have fun!

## TRY

Susan is crazy
= jan Susan li nasa

Go!
= o tawa!

Mama, wait
= mama o awen

I come from Europe. [Europe = Elopa]
= mi kama tan ma Elopa

Hahaha! That's funny.
= a a a! ni li musi

My name is Ken
= nimi mi li Ken

Hello, Lisa.
= jan Lisa o, toki

I want to go to Australia. [Australia = Oselija]
= mi wile tawa ma Oselija

Bye! (spoken by the person who's leaving)
= mi tawa

mi wile kama sona e toki Inli
= I want to learn English

o tawa musi poka mi!
= Dance with me

jan Mose o lawa e mi mute tawa ma pona
Moses, lead us to the good land

tawa pona
= good bye (spoken by the person who is staying)

# questions using seme

just like in Chinese
since we are using the rigid order of words
to show the different meaning
between the words in one sentence
we can easily let "shen me" get different meanings
by puting it into different positions

"seme li utala e sina?"
= "What attacked you?"

"seme li moku e kili mi?"
= "What is eating my fruit?"

"seme li lon poka mi?"
= "What is beside me?"

"seme li lon tomo mi?"
= "What is in my house?"

"seme li pona tawa sina?"
= "What is good to you? What do you like?"

so the word order of sentence dose not change
in a question

"jan seme li moku?"
= "Who is eating?"

"jan seme li tawa poka sina?"
= "Who went with you?"

"sina kama tan ma seme?"
= "Which country do you come from?"

"sina kama tan seme?"
= "You came because-of what?"

"jan seme li lon?"
OR "jan seme li lon ni?"
= "Who's there?"

"sina tawa poka jan seme?"
= "Whom did you go with?"

"moku li pona tawa ona"
= "He loves to eat"

"mi lon tan seme?"
= "I exist because-of what?"
OR "Why I am here?"

"jan seme li meli sina?"
= "Who is your girlfriend?"
