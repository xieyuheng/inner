# the groupoid model

Types in intensional type theory with their identity types
could be regarded as groupoids.

- the 1998 paper of Hofmann and Streicher called
  "The groupoid interpretation of type theory"
  in which they showed that
  intensional type theory had a model in the category of groupoids.

- "universe extensionality"
  and the univalence axiom of Vladimir Voevodsky

# model categories and higher groupoids

The first higher-dimensional models of intensional type theory
were constructed by Steve Awodey and his student Michael Warren in 2005
using Quillen model categories.

# The univalence axiom, synthetic homotopy theory, and higher inductive types

The concept of a univalent fibration was introduced by Voevodsky in early 2006
