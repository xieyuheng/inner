# Abstract

We offer an introduction for mathematicians
to the univalent foundations of Vladimir Voevodsky,
aiming to explain how he chose to encode mathematics in type theory
and how the encoding reveals a potentially viable foundation
for all of modern mathematics that can serve as an alternative to set theory.
