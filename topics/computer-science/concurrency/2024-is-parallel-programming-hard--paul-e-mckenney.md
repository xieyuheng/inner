# My Motive

[2025-02-23] 为了实现 inet-lisp 而学 parallel programming。
开始是读 2024-shared-memory-synchronization，
但是感觉读地有点累，感觉需要更多的例子才能更好理解。
因此看看这本看起来更轻松的书。

# Chapter 1 How To Use This Book

> The purpose of this book is to help you program shared-memory
> parallel systems without risking your sanity.
>
> - Or, perhaps more accurately, without much greater risk to your
>   sanity than that incurred by non-parallel programming. Which, come
>   to think of it, might not be saying all that much.

# Chapter 2 Introduction
