# Chapter 1 Introduction

## 1.3 Mathematical Background

We can represent a relation as a table.

Consider object and attribute (property)
-- like in formal concept analysis.

API:

```
Table = { schema: Schema, objects: Array(Object) }

tableSelection(table, record): Table
tableProjection(table, names): Table
objectProjection(table, names): Table
tableJoin(table, table): Table
```
