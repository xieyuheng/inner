## Preface to the Second Edition

> When the present book was written in the early 1980s, the theory of
> tree automata, tree languages and tree transformations was young but
> already quite extensive. Our aim was to give a systematic and
> mathematically sound exposition of some central parts of this
> subject. The presentation uses universal algebra in the spirit of
> J. R. Büchi and J. B. Wright from whose ideas of automata as
> algebras tree automata once emerged. That the algebraic formalism
> encourages and supports precise definitions and rigorous proofs may
> explain why the book has remained a general reference for many
> mathematically minded workers in the field ever since its
> publication in 1984.

## Preface to the Original Edition

> The purpose of this book is to give a mathematically rigorous
> presentation of the theory of tree automata, recognizable forests,
> and tree transformations. Apart from its intrinsic interest this
> theory offers some new perspectives to various parts of mathematical
> linguistics. It has also been applied to some decision problems of
> logic, and it provides tools for syntactic pattern recognition. We
> have not even tried to discuss all aspects of the subject or any of
> the applications, but enough central material has been included to
> give the reader a firm basis for further studies.

> Being relatively new and very manyfaceted, the field still lacks a
> uniform widely accepted formalism. We have chosen the language of
> universal algebra as our vehicle of presentation. However, we have
> not assumed that the reader is familiar with universal algebra; the
> preparatory sections in Chapter 1 should make the book
> self-contained in this respect. On the other hand, it is natural to
> assume that anyone interested in such a book has some general
> mathematical training and some knowledge of finite automata and
> formal languages.

> The book consists of four chapters, a bibliography and an index.
>
> - The first chapter contains an exposition of the necessary
>   universal algebra and lattice theory, as well as a quick review of
>   finite automata and formal languages. We also recommend some books
>   on these subjects.
>
> - In Chapter 2 trees, forests, tree recognizers, tree grammars, and
>   some operations on forests are introduced. Several
>   characterizations and closure properties of recognizable forests
>   are presented.
>
> - Chapter 3 is devoted to the connections between recognizable
>   forests and context-free languages.
>
> - Chapter 4 deals with tree transducers and tree transformations.
