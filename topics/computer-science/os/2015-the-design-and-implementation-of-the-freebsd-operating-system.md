# intro

- (1993)
  The NetBSD group emphasized portability and the minimalist approach,
  porting the systems to nearly 60 platforms and they were determined to keep the system lean
  to aid embedded applications.

  The FreeBSD group emphasized maximal support for the PC architecture
  and pushed to ease installation for, and market their system to, as wide an audience as possible.

- (1995)
  the OpenBSD group split from the NetBSD group
  to develop a distribution that emphasized security.

- (2003)
  the Dragonfly group split from the FreeBSD group
  to develop a distribution that used a significantly lighter-weight mechanism to support multiprocessing.

- The licensing terms of FreeBSD do not require the distribution of changes
  and enhancements to the system.

  The licensing terms of Linux require that
  all changes and enhancements to the kernel be made available in source form at minimal cost.
  Thus, companies that need to control the distribution of their intellectual property
  build their products using FreeBSD.

- Because of the intense peer review
  and insistence on well-defined coding standards throughout its 35-year lifetime,
  the FreeBSD kernel is considerably cleaner, more modular,
  and thus easier to understand and modify
  than most software projects of its size and age.
