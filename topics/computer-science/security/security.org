* Threat Models

*** how to think about security

    - policy -- what good guys want to achieve
    - Threat Models -- what bad guys can do
    - mechanism -- how to protect good guys

* Control Hijacking Attacks

*** attack buffer overflow

    - system softwares are often written in c
      problem of c is that
      c exposes raw memory addresses
      and perform no boundary checks

    - attackers know about x86 arch
      about the stack
      -- no data-stack and return-stack separation

    - buffer is allocated on stack

    - buf-128-gets-out pattern

*** bound check

    - buddy allocator

    - bound table for pointer bound check
      actually an array of log of bounds

* Buffer Overflow Exploits and Defenses

* Privilege Separation

* Capabilities
