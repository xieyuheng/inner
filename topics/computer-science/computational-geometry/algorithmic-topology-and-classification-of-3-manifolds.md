*** 1 simple and special polyhedra

***** 1.1 spines of 3-manifolds

******* 1.1.1 collapsing

        - elementary simplicial collapse of simplicial complex

        - elementary polyhedral collapse
          defined by triangulation
          and elementary simplicial collapses

        - simplicial collapse and polyhedral collapse

******* 1.1.2 spines

        - a spine of a compact connected 3-dimensional manifold with boundary M.
          is a subpolyhedron P that M collapses to.

          a spine of a closed connected 3-manifold M
          is a spine of M with a 3-ball removed.

          a spine of a disconnected 3-manifold
          is an union of spines of its connected components.

        - any compact triangulated 3-manifold M
          always possesses a spine of dimension <= 2.

        - It is often convenient to view a 3-manifold
          as a mapping cylinder over its spine
          - by a map from its boundary to its spine

          and as regular neighborhoods of the spines
          - a regular neighborhood of P in M
            is a submanifold of M that can be collapsed onto P

******* 1.1.3 simple and special polyhedra

        - A spine of a 3-manifold M carries much information about M.
          In particular, if boundary of M is not empty,
          then any spine P of M is homotopy equivalent to M.

          but, two nonhomeomorphic manifolds can have homeomorphic spines.
          [annulus and möbius-strip both collapse to circle]

        - Any compact 3-manifold possesses a special spine.
          - x -
            這裏描述的是 3-manifold 的 2-skeleton 的限制

        - If two compact connected 3-manifolds have homeomorphic special spines
          and either both are closed or both have nonempty boundaries,
          then these 3-manifolds are homeomorphic.
