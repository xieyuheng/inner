***** 1.1 diagonals and triangulations

      - Definition.
        A triangulation of a polygon P
        is a decomposition of P into triangles
        by a maximal set of noncrossing diagonals.

        - thus it is not allowed to add vertices into the polygon.

      - Lemma 1.3.
        Every polygon with more than three vertices has a diagonal.

      - Theorem 1.4. Every polygon has a triangulation.

      - a tetrahedralization of a polyhedron
        is a partition of its interior into tetrahedra
        whose edges are diagonals of the polyhedron.
