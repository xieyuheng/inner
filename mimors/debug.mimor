<question>
  What is the cause of an effect?

  <answer>
    The cause of an effect is an attribute (or an aspect) of a model,
    when we change it the effect will change because of it.

</question>

<question>
  What is a model?

  <answer>
    All cause must be understand in the context of a model.

    (See Judea Pearl's book "Causality -- Models, Reasoning, and Inference".)

    When trying to find the cause of a bug, our program is the model.
