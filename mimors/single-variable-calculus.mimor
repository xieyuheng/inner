  What is the fundamental theorem of calculus.

  <answer>
    The derivative of the area under the graph of a function,
    gives you back the function defining the graph itself.

    A(x) is the area under the graph of f(x)

    dx is infinitesimal

    dA = A(x) - A(x + dx)

    dA / dx = f(x)

    A(x) is called the integral of f(x)
