# cicada

- implicit
- inductive type
- quotient type -- learn from lean
- git-based wiki system

# dance with expressions

- use graph to implement lambda calculus
  - prove theorems about lambda calculus for both graph and tree syntax, and compare the proofs
  - we need to implement a graph library -- with API designed to implement lambda calculus and other rewrite systems

- try `(env: Env) => Exp` as `Value` -- no closure
- frontend dance
- use lean to prove classic theorems about lambda calculus

# lowdim

- use `NodeId`, `NodeMap`, `EdgeId`, `EdgeMap` and so on -- to avoid copy whole graph

# back to little books

- `xieyuheng/list` a List library for js
