title: Learn by implementing and teaching
---

We'd better learn by implementing and teaching.

I define better learning as more clear understanding.

Clear understanding allow us to use the techniques in new ways.

I believe that the best way to learn something is to implement it.

Because during implementation,
we have to explain our understanding to a machine,
which help us testing our understanding to force it to be clear.

And I believe learning is even better if we teach it to others.

Because the act of expressing ourself will yield results
that help us review our understanding in the future.

I define teaching as try to express to be understood by others,
and enjoy feedback from others.

Forms of teaching:

- Dialogue
- Puzzle

Note that, feedback is the key, both for learner and the teacher.
