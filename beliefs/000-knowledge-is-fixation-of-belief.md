title: Knowledge is fixation of belief
---

After read Charles Sanders Peirce's works,
I **define** knowledge as fixation of belief.

Beliefs are useful for a man, in the sense of
helping him to make decisions in life.

Beliefs might be wrong.

Thus it is useful to explicitly spoken out his beliefs,
prepare them to be proven wrong.

Otherwise he might have wrong beliefs that are implicit,
which will mislead him in life.
