Example algebra of 1-dimension

- Take presentation of group as example
- Take interesting groups as example (fundamental polygon)

Example algebra of 2-dimension

Example algebra of 3-dimension -- for `Pi(3)(S(2))`

About implementation:

- If we think about how to implement higher order incidence relation
  by objects and pointers,
  and we store pointers at both direction at every order,
  the implementation will be a graph model of cell-complex.

- Should we use hypergraph to encode higher order incidence relation?

Product space -- and boundary operator over it.
