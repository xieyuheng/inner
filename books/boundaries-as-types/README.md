[ [READONLY.LINK](https://readonly.link/books/https://inner.xieyuheng.com/books/boundaries-as-types/book.json) ]

A language to capture the concept of continuum,

- by viewing boundary as type,
- to formalize constructions in algebraic topology.

It can be viewed as higher dimensional algebraic structure in which,

- homotopy groups are it's sub-algebras,
- and it's abelianization are homology groups.
