# [question]

- What is DTD (Document Type Definition)?
  Is it formal grammar of the parse-tree?

- people used SGML to write books in the past?
  how are text processing
  and book publishing done nowadays?

# intro

- SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup Language,
  became an ISO standard in 1986.

- This ISO standard explains
  how documents may be split into
  a part containing the text
  and a part describing its structure
  without reference to a particular text processing system.

- SGML conforming documents can be interchanged and processed
  on many different systems in many different ways.
  Programs can analyse SGML texts
  because their structure is clearly indicated.
  Hence computers can manage large amounts of complex data
  and provide easier access to this data.

- applications
  CALS -- (Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistics Support)
  EDI -- (Electronic Data Interchange)
  - which is not an SGML application
    but which could profit from becoming one

# 1.1 A brief history of SGML

- To get a feeling for what markup is,
  consider the traditional processing of texts
  arriving at a publisher, ready to be printed.

- The copy-editor annotates manuscripts with instructions
  to the type-setter concerning layout, fonts, spacing,
  indentation and so on.
  These hand written instructions
  are traditionally called *markup*.
