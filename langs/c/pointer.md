# pointer

- A pointer is a variable declared to store a memory address.
  Its declaration will also tell you the type of data it points to.

# get a pointer

# get address of a variable and assign it to a pointer

- You can retrieve the memory address of your variables, then mess with them.
  use `&` to do so -- `&v`.

# get the value at the address a pointer is pointing to
