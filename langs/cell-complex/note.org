#+title: algebraic topology note

* [todo-list]

  - 現在有了
    1. 構造幾何對象的形式語法
    2. 判斷(低階)幾何對象之間的同倫等價的方法
    而 引入同倫等價這個概念 最初就是爲了在計算同倫群時
    給出 判斷群中元素是否等價的方式

* a reading guide of hott

  - always concern yourself about the geometry aspects
    of the formal language,
    because the language is to be used as a formalization
    of the geometry intuition of human.

  - a type is a geometry object.
    a definition of a geometry object is just like
    a description of how you could draw a picture of the geometry object.

  - constructors are used to construct geometry objects.
    | level | geometry object |
    |-------+-----------------|
    |     0 | point           |
    |     1 | path            |
    |     2 | surface         |
    |   ... | ...             |

  - cell complex
    注意 不能跨階粘貼邊界
    boundary
    ><><><
    note that the '=' based syntax is not 對稱
    因爲 (例如就二階元素而言) p = q 等價於 p q^{-1} = 1
    在高階的情形更是如此

  - a dependent type is a type family,
    a type family is a fibration,
    a function of such type is a section of the fibration.

  - all functions are considered continuous.
    when you want to find a function of certain type,
    such as (A -> B), (x:A -> B(x)),
    it must satisfy some constrains to be continuous.
    what are such constrains?

    - a fibration is a type family,
      a type family can be used as a function.
      to be able to describe the constraint of continuous function,
      what constrains a type family must satisfy?

  - a type is a proposition,
    a function body of such type is its proof.
    a proof is a record of deduction steps
    that finally would arrive the proposition.

  - what is the meaning of being constructive?

* the meaning of being constructive

  - deduction system 與 rewrite system 之間的關係
    首先以 deduction system 爲本
    設計用來記錄 record of deduction steps 的語法
    此時的語法並沒有 rewrite 的意義

  - rewrite 的意義來原於
    1. constructor 作爲平凡的函數體
    2. 定義函數體的 pattern match 語法使得新定義的函數體描述 rewrite

  - 注意
    type class 的接口函數名字 與 constructor 不同
    不能被當作平凡函數體
    我想這就是 logic harmony
    constructor 構造
    而 pattern match 解構

* constraint of fibration

  - to be able to describe the constraint of continuous function,
    a fibration must also has a function body for its transport.
    because constraints of continuous function of fibration
    are described by transport.

  - 如果 一個 dependent type 不足以確定一個 fibration
    即 還需要明確指定其 transport
    那麼 就不可能有一般的 獲得 transport 的函數體 的方式

* 單值性 與 連續性

  - 當把 path 理解爲 geometry object 時
    函數定義的基本限制是 連續性

  - 當把 path 理解爲 引入的等詞時
    函數定義的基本限制是 也可以被理解爲 單值性

* higher inductive definition

  - ~ 是遞歸展開
    = 是遞歸基礎

* >< continuous

  - (A -> B)

  - (x:A -> B(x))

* (Σ2 ~> S^1) 與 (ΣΣ2 ~> S^2)

  - 函數之間的 同倫 記 '~'
    空間之間的 同倫等價 記 '~>'

  - 目前所有的計算都來源於想要證明
    Σ2 ~> S^1 與 ΣΣ2 ~> S^2
    證明 '~>'
    即 構造兩個作爲 fibration 的特殊 path space 中的元素
    f : (A ~> B)
    g : (B ~> A)
    k : ((a : A) -> a f g = a)
    z : ((b : B) -> b g f = b)

* f ~ g [curry vs uncurry]

  #+begin_src scheme
  (def f
    (lambda (-> [A] [B])
      ...))
  (def g
    (lambda (-> [A] [B])
      ...))

  ;;;; f ~ g

  ;; curry

       (-> [:a #1] [:a g])}

    the equality of function is defined by equality of value
    [no matter curry or uncurry]

         我知道我不必找到一個終極的目的之後
         才能爲了這個目的而行動
         我可以用別的方式來理解行動
         或者來說服自己去行動
         但是
         亞里士多德的書給了我們一些希望
         不是嗎

    - k ::
         at1 如果能促進 at
         那麼 at 之用就是 at1 之用

    - x ::
         但是我想找更直接的用

* [note]

   - pattern match is about reverse and reversible function
     we need to learn more about reverse and dual

   - ><><><
     in a practical langauge
     beside algebraic datatype
     there is also record
     which is used as the named product type
     some interface functions can be generated by these names
     - I need to designed syntax for this too
       maybe {} should be used for them

   - if type can be generated
     then we have many ways to define a type
     - thus how a type is defined
       should be part of the metadata of a type
     - thus how a function is defined
       should also be part of the metadata of a function

   - meta programming is about macro
     when we are able to write macro
     how should we type macro

   - to be constructive
     a quotient space should be defined by a natural-projection
     maybe fiber bundle should also be defined by projection

   - ><><><
     the gluing of adjunction is the same as
     that of the gluing of fibers?

* [note] quotient space

  - to define a quotient space
    is to lessen the equality

  - the construction of quotient space
    is also called topological identification

  - there are many patterns by which we can re-implement equality of a type

  - when one is trying to formalize a concept in math
    he should try to use all the implementation tech
    and all the language paradigms

  - but it seems we have a basic uniformed equality in the term-lattice
    re-implement of equality is to be built on top of it

  - to say a map is continuous
    is to allow it to be used in the language

* set

*** [note] set theory vs type theory

    - ><
      what is this vs?

    - class (in oo) is encoded by a list of interface functions
      type-class (in haskell) is encoded by a list of abstract interface functions
      which all seem like the dual of the poset structure of set as cat

    - the methods of set theory have no fault
      the fault is to not to view them with implementation in mind

*** the encoding of type

    #+begin_src scheme
    (def-type T
      T.C = [(c1 : (* -> T))
             (c2 : (* -> T))]
      T.G = [(g1 : (term -> bool))
             (g2 : (term -> bool))]
      T.I = [(i1 : (T -> *))
             (i2 : (T -> *))
             (note
               interface functions are implemented by term rewriting)
             (note
               interface can be limited by type-cless)])

    (T1 < T2 :=
        T1.C < T2.C
        T1.G > T2.G)

    (note
      T1.I < T2.I
      T1 is a quotient space of T2)

    (note
      comparing can only be done by comparing list of names
      or declared relation between names
      (naming itself is also a declaration))

    (note
      names are made as unique as possible
      this labor can be easied by a module-system or infer-system)

    (note
      constructor can be shared by different types
      thus can not infer a unique type from a constructor
      thus cut needs to do search and backtracing)

    ;; in the view of
    ;; function as proof and type as theorem and space

    (note
      union of two types as a list of glue operations
      intersection in the two types will intro new connection
      continuous is all about levels of glues
      maybe the main formal law of continuous condition is hidden in the union)

    (def-function union)
    (def-function intersection)

    (note
      the formalization of gluing
      must be with detailed info about the gluing is done
      if i view union as gluing
      the info will be denoted by the global-naming-as-mark
      two types with the same constructor can still be seprated or not?)

    (note
      to define a named type
      is to intro a named level structure over the space of terms)

    #+end_src

*** >< cartesian product

    - cartesian product of two type is a special case of
      general cartesian product
      which is the space of section of fiber bundle
      (i.e. dependent function space)
      (not the total space)

    - actually we can see
      the dependent function space is not about fiber bundle
      but only about general cartesian product
      to get fiber bundle we need more info

* >< topology

*** [note]

    - ><
      how this would improve my understanding of
      the formalization of continuous function in my language

    - how the concept of continuous is formalized by abstract axioms of topology
      not only by open set but by the union and intersection functions

* [todo-list]

  - why design at1?
    what is the use of at?
    why lisp was designed?
    why riemman did his study?
    can we use n-level to model things
    which are not in the kingdom of at theory?
    what I want to do with at1?

  - eq must be able to be used as a rewriter
    and not like arrow
    it can rewrite data in both ways
    it uses unify instead of cover

  - homology and homotopy uses different type-check for dc and for function

* at

  - at -{formalization or algebraiclization}-> infi-groupoid

* chiso

  - type as proposition
    function-body as proof

  - 在 sequent0 中 可以定義數據
    還可以定義變化這些數據的函數
    之後我們就能 '證明' add/commute 這種函數的性質
    這些性質也是藉助 eq 和 has-length 之類的 tc 來表達的

  - 而在 at1 中
    也是定義數據
    但是所允許定義的數據不同了
    然後定義變化這些數據的函數
    但是檢查這些函數合法性的方式也不同了

  - 同樣是結構
    但是用以檢查結構合法性的方式不同了
    這樣就形成了不同的理論和不同的語言

* tc & dc

  - to define a type by higher-inductive-type
    is like to describe how to draw it level-by-level

  - rules for production-by-gluing

    1. production in many ways
       not as classical algebra
       product along common border

    2. position of element in border is important
       same-position-self-production will be canceled
       this is the concept of the reverse-of-element generalized

    3. n+1-level elements as relation of n-level elements
       thinking about a combinatorial infi-groupoid theory

  - to intro a new n+1-level dc for a type
    we need to form a closed orientable n-level element
    by producting many n-level elements
    this closed orientable n-level element will be viewed as
    the border of the newly intro-ed dc

* function

  - to capture the concept of continuity
    we define function level-by-level
    for all the levels of the input type

  - type-check for elements of level above 0
    is like continuity-check

  - continuity-check of 1-level elements
    uses the rewrite-rule of 0-level elements

    - ><><><
      a group of specific principles are needed
      as a general way to generate the border-condition
      (A B -> C)
      (:a :b -> :c {:c : border-condition})
      the border-condition must be generated from
      the value
      on  ((border :a) :b ->?)
      and (:a (border :b) ->?)

    - ><><><
      this is where the dependent-type come into play

    - ><><><
      (border (:a * :b)) = (((border :a) * :b) + (:a * (border :b)))

* >< elim diff-level-map as product-type-map

  - uncurry level to number of input elements

* the extension problem

  - not the extension of a function
    of which the input type is a subtype of another
    but the extension of a partial function
    which is defined only for part of the dc of the input type

* 關於生成無窮多樣數據的方式

  - 在 at1 中定義一個 type
    其 0 階元可能只有有限多個
    而其 1 階元可能有無限多個
    相反在 sequent0 中
    一個 type 中只有 0 階構造子
    而其無限多元素只能通過遞歸定義來生成

  - 這是因爲 at1 中的一階或更高階元素可以做乘法
    而這種乘法可以生成無限多元素

* 從代數角度考察連續性

  - at1 中的一個函數可以作用於屬這某 type 的所有階元素
    包括這些在乘法下生成的元素
    而函數的定義是有限的
    定義這個函數時
    只要對這個 type 的有限個 dc 描述函數所施的變化就行了
    對於相乘而來的元素
    函數所施的變化由函數與乘法的交換性來完成
    即 所有的函數都是 type 之間的同態

  - sequent0 中也可以定義能處理無限多數據的函數
    不同點在於
    此時 type 只有 0-level 元素
    元素之間沒有乘法
    每個 dc 代表了 type 的一類數據
    函數定義只要覆蓋了所有這些 dc
    就能處理屬這個 type 的所有數據了
    此時並沒有什麼同態發生

* 具體的連續性檢查

  - 如此說來 連續性檢查 就是 同態性檢查
    但是 我們知道 連續性檢查 的具體形式是
    (f a) : (G (f (border a)))
    爲什麼它就算是連續性檢查呢
    因爲假設我們有
    a : 0 == 1
    b : 1 == 2
    如過想要定義 f 使得
    (f (a + b)) = ((f a) + (f b))
    如果 (f a) 和 (f b) 還想要相 glue
    就必須保證 (f a) 的末點和 (f b) 的始點相同
    而 continuity-check 是用
    (f a) : (f 0) == (f 1)
    (f b) : (f 1) == (f 2)
    此時 (f a) 的末點和 (f b) 的始點 都是 (f 1)

* at1 之於 at

  - 首先 at 作爲一個數學結構
    有其對象 即拓撲空間
    at 給出了空間之間的基本等詞的定義 即同胚
    這個等詞難以計算於是就有了 at 中的 a 與 同倫
    [畢竟有了等詞之後自然就有分類問題]
    我們在 at1 中定義 type
    就是給出 at 這個數學結構的研究對象
    而我們能就我們所定義的對象 來定義 at 中的基本等詞
    這樣我們就把一個數學理論形式化了

* 被檢查的其他條件

  - 這包括 closeness 和 orientable
    由 (border (:a * :b)) = (((border :a) * :b) + (:a * (border :b)))
    看來 (border (border :x)) = 0 如果對於所有 dc 成立
    那麼對於所有 dc 相 + 而得的數據也成立

  - 同樣 orientable 可能也有這個性質
    即 被 * 與 + 保持

  - 類似的性質可能不只是 closeness 和 orientable
    這些性質都可能被作爲檢查的條件

* 何謂計算同倫羣

  - 我之前認爲這在於
    找出一組形式簡單且易於比較的已知其不同倫的空間
    然後證明所要求同倫羣的空間與其同倫
    並且還要發展出系統的方法來這樣做
    這才稱得上是計算

  - 但是
    一個空間有多階同倫羣
    如果是與基本的已知不同倫的一組空間比較
    那麼這 多階 又是如何體現出來的呢

* 同倫羣是函數空間 [arrow-type] 而不是空間本身 [type]

  - 如何處理函數空間之間的等價

  - 注意
    在 hott 中 同倫羣並非 arrow-type 而是 path-type
    我想 這就是我所謂的 uncurry 與 curry 的處理方式不同了吧

  - 之前的想法是用 與典型的空間之等價 來說明同倫羣的計算
    其實 用典型的 arrow-type 也可以
    用典型的 path-type 也可以
    計算的本質如此

  - 函數空間 之等價 就是 arrow-type 之等價

  - 注意
    對一般 type 而言
    證明空間之間同倫等價
    是被劃歸到證明函數之間同倫的

*** 引

    - x ::
         對於一個類型 可以引入高階 data-constructor
         與 構造 0 階數據的 data-constructor 不同
         高階的 data-constructor 之引入不是自由的
         它們的類型需要滿足各種條件
         homology 與 homotopy 所需要的條件可能不同
         等等

    - k ::
         其實
         構造 0 階數據的 data-constructor 的類型也是有限制的
         它的返回值必須屬這個類型本身

    - x ::
         定義類型[space]的過程就是描述一個幾何體[拓撲體]構造的過程
         類型系統的特點就是兩層數據
         在 sequent0 中我們已經能看出來
         有 main-rewrite 也有檢驗部分
         通常是 body-arrow 爲 main-rewrite
         但也可能是 type-arrow 爲 main-rewrite
         在 higher-inductive-type 中我們也能看出來
         此時的 body 是平凡的
         而 type 上的檢驗可以多種多樣
         homology 的檢驗可能較爲寬鬆
         homotopy 的檢驗可能更嚴格 並且還要檢驗可定向性 等等
         檢驗的方式不同
         所允許的構造就不同
         用 '圖像' 來理解這些構造的方式也不同
         homology 可能是 non-determinate
         homotopy 可能是 determinate
         等等
         甚至形式化之後的 homotopy 已經與古典不同
         都有可能

* at1 的目的

  - 設計 at1 還有類似語言的目的在於
    我發現 當形式化某個領域之後
    就可能用計算機來實現這個形式系統
    如此我的目的有二
    1. 把數學知識變具體 這關乎教學
    2. 把對數學知識之 '價值' 之評價變得客觀
       消除主管評價數學成果的價值之必要
