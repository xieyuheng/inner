------

My aim here is to present to you my attitude to teaching.
It is not a method, it is not a system.
Teaching is not a science, it is a art.
You can not put it clearly in a system, but you may have an attitude to it.

This attitude can not be easily described in words,
this attitude can be more described in acts.

But I can tell you a few slogans.

------

Let me put my first point in a question answer form.

&gt; What is teaching?

In my opinion, teaching is giving opportunity to the students
to discover things by themselves.

Not the teacher should tell the things to the students,
if they wish to learn it really, they have to discover it.

------

A second point.

&gt; First guess, then prove.

------

My third point, application of the second point to mathematics.

&gt; Finished mathematics consists of proofs, but mathematics in the making, consists of guesses.
