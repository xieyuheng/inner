# category theory
# topos theory
- we are interested in topos theory
  because we want to know
  is topos theory the algebraic semantics
  behind the use of partial function?
- use partial function to specify algebraic structure
  - essentially algebraic theories
  - C-system
  - "Aspects of topoi", by Peter Freyd, 1972.
  - what is the main idea of topos theory?
    capture membership relation?
  - what is the relation between topos and partial function?
  - this might be very useful to
    - use algebraic structure in language without dependent type
    - capture composition of pi type in the dependent type theory
# categorical semantics

- inversion principle of inference rule is special case of adjoint functor
- is it make sences to introduce (- A) and { A } to factor A -> B ?
- some questions for luo
  - what is categorical semantics of inductive type ? -- F-algebra, and initial algebra
  - what is categorical semantics of dependent type ? -- also adjoint functor

# proof theory
- [schroeder-heister]
  - standard formulation of elimination rule for implication
    v.s. another elimination rules to follow the same pattern,
    that is, the pattern exhibited by the rules of falsehood, disjunction, and existence elimination,
    has been considered by Schroeder-Heister.

# algebraic data type
- maybe before implementing inductive type
  we should study algebraic data type first
# jojo
- in jojo cut is the only inference rule that requires two premises
  - inference rule with one premise can be viewed as equation?
- Monoidal category, should we understand element in language as object instead of arrow,
  and use the bifunctor of Monoidal category to model composition? (instead of composition of arrow.)
