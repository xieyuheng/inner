#+title: Critique of Feynman Algorithm

* Feynman Algorithm

  - Write down the problem.
    Think real hard.
    Write down the solution.

  - The Feynman algorithm was facetiously suggested by Murray Gell-Mann,
    a colleague of Feynman, in a New York Times interview.

* Sussman Algorithm

  - Write down the problem.
    Build a (thus debug-able) almost-right solution and debug it.
    Loop.

* Example

  - To design a typed language,
    I write the `eval` first.

  - Then the problem is that I need some checkers.
    I can debug checkers, because I have the `eval`.
