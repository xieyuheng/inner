## Readings

The main textbook on formal concept analysis (FCA) is

B. Ganter and R. Wille: Formal Concept Analysis: Mathematical Foundations. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg (1999)

The following book is geared towards computer science practitioners, and it focuses on potential applications of concept lattices, in particular, in data mining and information retrieval:

C. Carpineto and G. Romano: Concept Data Analysis: Theory and Applications. John Wiley & Sons (2004)

The recently published book

B. Ganter and S. Obiedkov: Conceptual Exploration. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg (2016)

provides an introduction to FCA and focuses on a knowledge acquisition technique that we'll study in Week 5.

Many publications on FCA can be found in the proceedings of the conference series CLA (“Concept Lattices and their Applications”), ICFCA (“International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis”), and ICCS (“International Conference on Conceptual Structures”).
