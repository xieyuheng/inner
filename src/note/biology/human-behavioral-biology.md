## Introduction to Human Behavioral Biology

- (About categorical thinking)

  When you think in categories, you underestimate how different two facts are when they fall in the same category.
  When you think in categories, you overestimate how different two facts are when there happens to be a boundary in between them.
  And when you pay too much attention to categorical boundaries, you don't see big pictures.
  Our goal in this class is to study behavior without falling into thinking in categories.

  We resist the pull to think categorically.

## Behavioral Evolution

- (Principles of Evolution)
  There is Evolution. Frequency of traits in populations change over time.
  - There are traits that are inheritable. (Traits that are genetic.)
  - There are different ways in which traits can occur.
  - Some version of these traits are more adoptive.
    (Adoptive about reproduction instead of survival.)

  There are random introduction of new type of traits.
  (There are mutations.)

Principles of Evolution applies to behavior.
(Certain behaviors are inheritable, and so on.)

We study how behaviors optimize reproduction.
- Individual selection, (a.k.a. natural selection).
- Sexual selection.
- Kin selection.

Evolution will sculpture behaviors.

  Although "to remain" is the a priority goal of existing,
  only things tend to remain will remain.

  We observed the above selections in the world,
  and use "to optimize reproduction" to explain.

  The other way around is to searching for behaviors (strategies)
  that optimize reproduction, and test them in the world.

Game theory, to optimize behaviors (behavior strategies),
(for example, when to cooperate and when to cheat).

One strategy can drive other strategies to extinction.

We can infer infer behaviors of species from Principles of Evolution
and the traits of species.
