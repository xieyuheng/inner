*** for cell complex

    - a cell complex only contains topological information
      to visualize it, we need to
      1. add geometrical information to it
      2. and project it to 2-dim with visual effects

* vector space and affine space

* curves in the plane

  - corner cutting algorithm

    an-algorithm-for-high-speed-curve-generation--chaikin.pdf

* two-dimensional graphics

  - setting up
    coordinate system
    color model

  - primitive shapes -- lines, rectangles
    API:
    #+begin_src js
    .path (point_array: Array <point_t>)
    .line (start: point_t, end: point_t)
    .cubic_bezier (
      start: point_t,
      end: point_t,
      start_control: point_t,
      end_control: point_t)
    .quadratic_bezier (
      start: point_t,
      end: point_t,
      control: point_t)
    #+end_src

  - transforms
    translate (4, 0)
    rotate (90)
