#+title: combinatorial game theory

* [note] affine space

  - the structure of combinatorial game is like affine space
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space
    point -- position
    translation -- choice

* Chapter I. Combinatorial Games

*** intro

    - characteristic
      - two-player
      - no hidden information
      - no chance elements

    - objectives
      - exact solutions to particular games
        usually in the form of an algebraic description of their outcomes
      - an understanding of the general combinatorial structure of games
      - hardness results, suggesting that for certain games
        or in certain situations, no concise solution exists

    - outcomes and solutions
      for example nim has two outcome classes -- win and loss
      (a function from a nim game to the set of win and loss)
      - first player has winning strategy
      - second player has winning strategy

      to solve a combinatorial game
      is to find a function to calculate the game's general outcome

      it is often simple to get a winning strategy from such function

    - normal play is additive
      misere play is not additive

    - partizan games with normal play (like hackenbush) have more outcome
      - first player has winning strategy
      - second player has winning strategy
      - left has winning strategy
      - right has winning strategy

      the game can bias one player

    - game, position, option
      - the author uses "ruleset, game, option"
        which is unnecessary term juggling

      game-t
      state-t

      direct-option
      indirect-option

      subposition
      proper-subposition

      run
      play

    - disjunctive sum

    - the fundamental equivalence

    - x -
      就 short, normal play 而言
      在 disjunctive sum 下 game 构成 abelian group

      可以想象到的 value of game 有五种
      利用归纳法可以证明其中没有制胜策略的情况不会出现

      surreal number 作为 value of game
      是用最优 move 对 game tree 的进行的总结

      注意 surreal number 中
      同时包含了 left 先手 和 right 先手 的情况

* [note] number of players

  - x -
    why only two players?
