#+title: mesh generation

- by Pascal Jean Frey and Paul-Louis George

* [todo]
- can general mesh be defined as polyhedral-complex
* 1 General Definitions

  - *mesh of convex hull*
    triangulation of convex hull can be used as an initial example,
    where the triangulation is also constrained
    by the structure of the domain's boundary.

    - where the convex hull is described by a set of points.
      (there might be points inside the hull)

    - x -
      the triangulation defined by the author,
      requires the points describing the convex hull
      been the set of vertices of the triangulation.

  - *Delaunay triangulation*
    triangulation with empty sphere criterion
    (co-circular allowed)

    There exists a unique Delaunay triangulation
    of a set of points,
    which is the dual of the Voronoi diagram
    associated with the set of points.

    - uniqueness is achieved
      if the points are in general position,

    - A set of points is said to be in general position
      if there is no configuration of more than three points
      that are co-circular (more than four co-spherical points)
      such that the corresponding open disk (ball) is empty.

    - for non general position,
      uniqueness holds if non-simplicial elements are allowed.

      the circle would be a circumscribed circle of a polygon,
      existence of Delaunay triangulation follows from this.

  - x -
    why the following natural structures looks like Voronoi diagram
    - the wings of cicada
    - the drying earth

  - *mesh*
    instead of convex hull
    general mesh must be defined for any bounded (closed) domain.

    - the internal points are not given.
      when generating such mesh, one must also generate them.

    - x -
      hull, but possibly non convex,
      how to represent such structures?
      alpha shape?

  - *structured mesh*
    A mesh is called structured,
    if its connectivityis of the finite difference type.

    - x -
      mesh with a coordinate system?

    - note that,
      quad or hex unstructured meshes are such that
      the internal vertices may be shared by
      more than 4 (8) elements
      (unlike the case of structured meshes).

  - *manifold*
    A surface mesh is called manifold,
    if its internal edges are shared by exactly two elements,
    or only one element, in the case of a boundary edge.

  - *mesh element*
    a priori indexing is used to define mesh element

    - x -
      my method for defining cell-complex
      does not need such a priori indexing

  - *finite element mesh*
    - x -
      author's the review is too brief for new comers

  - *mesh data structures*
    - x -
      author's design of data structure hardly worth reading
      I can optimize my definition cell-complex
      for special cells to get better data structure for meshing

  - *control space*
    metric tensor field -- to measure some aspect of the mesh

    - x -
      looks like morse theory

  - *neighborhood space*

    - x -
      topping the data structure of mesh,
      to help neighboring information queries

  - *mesh quality and mesh optimality*
    for instance, a nice looking mesh is a good mesh.

    - x -
      subjective to the use of the mesh

    - for examples:
      - Delaunay mesh been an example about polygon's angles
      - error estimate in the case of finite elements
      - finer discretizationin a boundary region results
