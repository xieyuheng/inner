* 0 Introduction and Examples

  - part of the work (and fun) consists in seeing how intuition from life in
    three dimensions can lead one (i.e., everyone, but not us) astray: there are
    many theorems about 3-dimensional polytopes whose analogues in higher
    dimensions fail badly. Thus, one of the main tasks for polytope theory is
    to develop tools to analyze and, if possible, "visualize" the geometry of
    higher-dimensional polytopes.

    in this book,
    vector in vector space are represented as column vector,
    and linear functions (e dual vector) as row vector.

* 1 Polytopes, Polyhedra, and Cones

* 2 Faces of Polytopes

  - x -
    a face of a polytope, is defined as
    a valid inequality of polytope.

    this feels good for facet,
    a facet corresponds to one valid inequality.

    but not for edge.
    because an edge might corresponds to
    infinitely many valid inequality.

  - x -
    the author uses valid inequality of vertex,
    to construct the vertex figure of a polytope,
    by moving the valid inequality toward the polytope a little bit.

    even my treatment of vertex figure for cell complex
    is more elegant than this.

  - Why is all this (poset order structure) interesting for us?
    Because we want to study the set of faces
    of a convex polytope, ordered by inclusion.

    - x -
      example poset order structure is set ordered by inclusion.

  - the face lattice is the proper framework to define
    combinatorial equivalence of polytopes.

    we define two polytopes P, Q
    to be combinatorially equivalent
    if there is a bijection
    (piecewise linear homeomorphism)
    between their faces
    that preserves the inclusion relation.

    i.e. P and Q are combinatorially equivalent,
    if and only if their face lattices are isomorphic.

*** 8.1 Shellable and Nonshellable Complexes

    - [polytopal complex]
      A polytopal complex (see Definition 5.1) is a finite, nonempty collection C
      of polytopes (called the faces of C) in Rd that contains all the faces of its
      polytopes, and such that the intersection of two of its polytopes is a face
      of each of them.

    - [pure complex]
      A polytopal complex is pure if each of its faces is contained
      in a face of dimension dim(C),
      that is, if all the inclusion-maximal faces of C,
      called the facets of C, have the same dimension.

    - [simplicial complex]
      A complex is simplicial if all its faces (equivalently, all its facets) are simplices.

    - [underlying set of complex]
      The underlying set of C is the union a of its faces.

    - x -
      the spanning tree algorithm gives the begining shelling of any graph.
      but shelling can have more edges than edges in the tree.

      the first stage of normalization of 2-dim manifold complex,
      is a shelling of the 2-manifold.

    - [shellable]
      A polytopal complex is shellable if it is pure and has a shelling.

    - when adding a new element to the existing shelling,
      then the intersection with what is already there must be
      1. connected
      2. pure (d - 1) dimensional

    - x -
      [about normalization of 3-dim manifold complex]
      first we try to union all the 3-cells into one 3-cell,
      pick one, adding others one by one,
      but we must ensure that,
      at each step,
      the unioned 3-cell
      can be views as a 3-cell,
      whose boundary sphere is attached to 2-skeleton of the space.

      what is preventing us from doing this for 3-dim manifold complex?
