    - topology is ostensibly the study of arbitrary continuous functions.
      in reality, however, we can comprehend and manipulate
      only functions which relate finite "chunks" of space
      in a simple combinatorial manner,
      and topology originally developed on this basis.

***** 0.1 The Fundamental Concepts and Problems ofTopology

******* 0.1.1 The Homeomorphism Problem

        - One may consider a geometric figure to be an arbitrary point set,
          and in fact the homeomorphism problem
          was first stated in this form, by Hurwitz 1897.
          However, this degree of generality
          makes the problem completely intractable,
          for reasons which belong more to set theory than geometry,
          namely the impossibility of describing or enumerating all point sets.

        - x -
          也就是說這種處理問題的方式不具有構造性
          沒法在計算機上用數據結構來實現這個模型
          更沒法用算法來實現就這個模型而敘述的函數

        - For the moment
          we wish to claim that all "natural" geometric figures
          are either simplicial complexes or homeomorphic to them,
          which is just as good for topological purposes.

        - knot complement in R3 is not finitely describable in terms of simplexes.

          again, glue is handled by quotient-space by the author.
          while in AT1, I handled it by common boundary.

******* 0.1.5 The H-ball and the ^-sphere

******* 0.1.6 Manifolds

        - x -
          這里給出了一個例子來說明
          #+begin_src scheme
          (type space
            (: base (-1 <>))
            (: p (0 base base))
            (: c (1 p p p)))
          #+end_src
          並非是 manifold
          也就是說 group 的 generators 與 relations
          所給出的 underlying-space 並非是 manifold

******* 0.1.7 Bounded Manifolds

        - x -
          既然可以把 manifold 推廣到 bounded manifold
          那麼也沒有什麼理由不把一般的 group 的 underlying-space
          包含到考慮範圍之內
          而所得到的 underlying-space 的差異
          都可以通過 group 的性質來描述

          之前問
          what are the underlying-space and covering-space
          of low order finite groups?
          現在知道這些就是不是 manifold 的空間了

          之前關於有限生成羣的分類的問題
          二維曲面的分類很簡單 因爲這些曲面是 很特殊的羣的 underlying-space
          而一般的羣的分類很難 對應的 underlying-space 的分類也將很難

          而且之所以我們的討論要限制於
          那些 underlying-space 是 manifold 的羣
          可能就是因爲這種羣的 underlying-space 可以有簡單的嵌入
          從而讓人能夠直觀

          而對一般的羣的 underlying-space 的研究
          其實都是用代數方法來完成的

        - In dimension 2
          we can distinguish manifolds from bounded manifolds
          by the fundamental group (4.2.1 and 5.3.3).

******* 0.1.8 Embedding Problems

        - next to the homeomorphism problem,
          the most important type of topological problem is that of
          distinguishing different embeddings of one figure in another.

        - x -
          這裏的 homeomorphism problem 代數化之後就是空間之間的同倫等價
          即 (~~ A B)
          而後面的的 embedding 問題就是特殊的函數之間的等價
          即 (~ f g)
          其特殊性在於
          證明等價時所用的 (-> (* A I) B) 不能有自交

******* 0.1.9 Homotopy and Isotopy

        - The group properties depend crucially on the fact that
          the curve is not required to be simple at any stage,
          and in fact the deformation may create more singularities
          than were present at the beginning.

          Only then can one introduce a product of closed curves,
          and cancel a closed curve by its inverse.

        - x -
          同倫羣的定義依賴於各階球面的自交的映射

        - isotopy seems to be a more natural notion of deformation,
          but it is not algebraically tractable.
          In the case of simple curves on a 2-manifold
          the situation is saved by a theorem of Baer 1928 (6.2.5)
          which says that simple curves are isotopic
          if and only if they are homotopic.

        - note the difference between

          - isotopy
            the "knotted part" can be shrunk to nothing
            without acquiring asingularity at any stage.

          - ambient-isotopy
            knot theory

        - x -
          在 AT1 中
          應該如何定義上面兩個概念
          如果要求 證明等價時所用的 (-> (* A I) B) 不能有自交
          是否就有了 ambient-isotopy?

          有可能不行
          因爲 ambient-isotopy 是用 (-> (* B I) B) 定義的

***** 0.2 Simplicial Complexes

******* 0.2.1 Definition and Basic Properties

        - simplicial complex as schema.
          It is a consequence of the triangulation and Hauptvermutung that
          all homeomorphism questions for 2- and 3-manifolds
          reduce to combinatorial questions about schemata.

******* 0.2.2 Orientation

        - in general,
          we interpret the ordered (n + 1)-tuple (P0, ..., Pn+1)
          as an orientation of the n-simplex.

          orientations are equivalent
          if they differ by an even permutation of the vertices,
          so there are in fact two possible orientations,
          - (+ (P0, ..., Pn+1)) which is just (P0, ..., Pn+1)
          - (— (P0, ..., Pn+1)) obtained by
            an odd number of exchanges of vertices.

        - an orientation of an n-complex
          is an assignment of orientations to its simplexes.
          The orientation is coherent
          if n-simplexes which share an (n-1)-dimensional face
          induce opposite orientations in that face.

******* 0.2.3 Realization in Euclidean Space

        - any n-complex can be embedded in R^(2n+1)

******* 0.2.4 Cell Complexes

        - in the last resort,
          one can always view cells and the dividing cells inside them
          as unions of simplexes in a simplicial decomposition.
          The point of considering cell complexes at all
          is to minimize the number of cells,
          which usually helps to shorten computations.

******* 0.2.5 Triangulation and Hauptvermutung

        - The Hauptvermutung (main conjecture) of Steinitz 1908
          states that homeomorphic manifolds are combinatorially homeomorphic.

***** 0.3 The Jordan Curve Theorem

******* 0.3.1 Connectedness and Separation

        - The statement, as a theorem,
          that every simple closed curve in R2
          separates it into two regions (Jordan 1887)
          was important in the history of topology
          as the first moment when an "obvious" fact
          was seen to require proof.

               (: [:g :v rev :g rev] N)])
          #+end_src

        - generating a subgroup by inverse and product,
          generating a normal subgroup also by conjugation.

          how about the fact that
          the fundamental group of a covering space of (underlying-space G)
          is a subgroup of G?

******* 0.5.5 Quotient Groups and Homomorphisms

        - we can get quotient group of a group representation
          by adding new relations.
          [where new relations generates a normal subgroup.]

        - isomorphism = (kernel = id)

*** 3 foundations for the fundamental group

***** 3.1 The Fundamental Group

******* 3.1.1 introductionthe fundamental group

        - such a definition
          makes the computation of generators and relations routine,
          but it is open to the objection that
          the group is not obviously a topological invariant.

          since the topologists of the time
          pinned their hopes on the hauptvermutung,
          they could be satisfied with a proof that
          the fundamental group was invariant under combinatorial homeomorphisms,
          which was supplied by tietze 1908.

        - the only group which has to be derived from first principles
          is that of the circle;
          all the other fundamental groups we need
          are then obtained by combining the simple technique of
          deformation retraction
          with the seifert-van kampen theorem.

******* 6.1.1 Introduction

        - The fundamental problem
          in the topological classification of curves on surfaces
          is to decide whether a given closed curve contracts to a point.
          We shall call this the contractibility problem.

        - The problem was solved,
          at least from a geometric point of view,
          with the introduction of the universal covering surface in the 1880s.

          If a curve p on the surface F
          is lifted to a curve p' in the universal covering surface F',
          then p contracts to a point on F if and only if p' is closed in F'.

          - x -
            note that,
            the covering-space of a closed surface
            can only be [hyperbolic] plane or sphere.
            plane and sphere both are simple-connected
            [with trivial fundamental-group].

          It is admittedly not very convenient
          because of the very dense packing of polygons required
          even for genus 2 (see Figure 111).

        - Dehn observed that
          the labelled net of polygons on the universal covering surface
          was in fact the Cayley diagram of the fundamental-group of F,
          and that the contractibility problem was therefore
          the same as the word problem for the fundamental-group of F.

          thus,
          Dehn's algorithm solves the problem.
          His first proof depended on the metric in the hyperbolic plane (Dehn 1912a),
          but he then saw how the algorithm could be justified
          by purely topological properties of the net (Dehn 1912b).

***** 8.1 Open Problems in Three-Dimensional Topology

******* 8.1.2 Methods of Constructing 3-manifolds

        - [simplicial decomposition]
          A 3-manifold is a union of solid tetrahedra
          with disjoint interiors,
          with at most two tetrahedra meeting at each face
          (exactly two for a closed manifold),
          and finitely many at each edge and vertex.

          Furthermore, the neighbourhood surface of each vertex
          must be a 2-sphere,
          so that each point in the complex
          has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to the 3-ball
          (see also 8.2).

          If the complex is finite,
          then all the above properties are decidable,
          so we have an algorithm for deciding
          whether a finite 3-complex is a manifold
          (and of course, for distinguishing
          between closed and bounded manifolds).

          As in dimension 2,
          we can amalgamate simplexes
          until we have a single polyhedron,
          homeomorphic to a ball,
          with faces identified in pairs.
          This cell decomposition method of constructing 3-manifolds
          is therefore completely general
          and could serve as an alternate definition
          provided we include the statement that
          the neighbourhood surface of each vertex is a sphere.

        - the remaining three methods of construction
          we shall mention yield only the orientable 3-manifolds.

        - [heegaard splitting]
          decomposes the manifold into two handlebodies.
          two handlebodies can produce infinitely many different manifolds
          via different homeomorphisms between their boundary surfaces.

          by starting with a simplicial decomposition.
          It is fairly easy to show that
          every finite orientable 3-manifold has a Heegaard splitting (8.3.1).

        - [dehn surgery]
          One removes some solid tori from an S3
          and sews them back differently.
          To obtain all orientable 3-manifolds
          the tori have to be knotted or linked in most cases.

          In 8.4 we shall follow Lickorish 1962 in
          deriving the surgery construction from a Heegaard splitting.

        - [branched coverings of S3]
          the 3-dimensional analogue of Riemann surfaces.
          Like surgery, it is generally based on knots or links,
          and can in fact be derived from the surgery construction
          (Lickorish 1973, see 8.5).

        - Each of the above methods
          yields a finite description of the 3-manifold
          which can be effectively translated into a simplicial decomposition.

          and different forms of description are intertranslatable.
          [which is often useful for showing that two manifolds are the same.]

          The problem is that
          the same manifold has infinitely many descriptions,
          so we cannot always be sure
          whether different descriptions
          actually represent different manifolds.

        - thus we have algorithm
          for effectively enumerating all finite 3-manifolds
          (with repetitions).

******* 8.1.3 The Homeomorphism Problem

        - Since we do not yet know how to recognize the simplest 3-manifold S3
          (see 8.1.4)
          it must be admitted that
          the homeomorphism problem is far frombeing solved.
          The principal obstacles seem to be
          1. absence of plausible normal forms,
          2. lack of bounds on the length of constructions
             which convert one desscription of a manifold to another.
             - to know when to stop looking for a description
               among the infinitely many descriptions equivalent to it.
               thus, bounding the length of the search.
               thus, we can solve the problem
               even when we do not have a normal form.

        - The homeomorphism problem has been solved
          for the subcase of lensspaces (Reidemeister 1935).
          We shall see in 8.3
          that the lens spaces are the 3-manifolds of Heegaard genus 1.

******* 8.1.5 An Unshellable Triangulation of the 3-ball

******* 8.1.6 The Poincare Conjecture

******* 8.1.7 The Word Problem for 3-manifold Groups

        - The Word Problem of fundamental group of 3-manifold,
          might be solvable,
          because many groups can not be fundamental group of 3-manifold.
          [for example, (Z x Z x Z x Z) (Stallings 1962)]

        - to solve the word problem in fundamental group of M,
          we only need to construct the universal covering space of M.
          The trouble is that we do not know
          what the potential covering spaces might be in general.

        - x -
          what is the relations between
          universal covering space
          and geometric of space.

******* 8.1.8 Above Dimension 3

        - It is not yet known whether all 4-manifolds can be triangulated.

        - any finitely presented group can be realized as fundamental group of a 4-manifold.

        - for dimensions >= 5,
          The Hauptvermutung is false (Milnor 1961).

***** 8.2 Polyhedral Schemata

******* 8.2.1 manifolds and pseudomanifolds

        - Poincare 1895 introduces the construction of 3-manifolds
          by identifying faces of simply-connected polyhedra :
          (1) a finite set of polyhedra (topological 3-balls) called cells, with disjoint interiors,
          (2) faces of cells identified in pairs, with vertices corresponding to vertices,
          (3) resulting in a connected complex.

        - However,
          Poincare observes that
          these conditions do not guarantee that
          the outcome will be a manifold.
          [thus, the concept of pseudomanifolds.]

          to get manifold,
          we need :
          (4) The neighbourhood surface of each vertex is a 2-sphere.

******* 8.2.2 The Euler Characteristic of a Pseudomanifold

        - 3-manifolds have Euler characteristic 0.
          [but pseudomanifold do not.]

******* 8.2.3 An Example

        - ><

******* 8.2.4 Remarks

        - Polyhedral schemata
          have never been used in a systematic way
          for the construction of 3-manifolds,
          even though some interesting manifolds
          originally arose in this way
          (for example lens spaces, cf. 4.2.8.
           See also Threlfall and Seifert 1930, 1932
           and Weber and Seifert 1933
           for manifolds obtainedfrom the Platonic solids).

          Apparently polyhedral schemata
          do not admit anything like the reductions applicable to polygon schemata,
          but it is not clear that anyone has worked very hard on the problem.

          Only recently, Thurston 1977 has found
          polyhedral forms of many 3-manifolds
          which can be used to tesselate hyperbolic 3-space,
          yielding a theory like the classical theory of 2-manifolds.

***** 8.3 Heegaard Splittings

******* 8.3.1 Existence

        - x -
          when getting heegaard-splitting from a polyhedral-schema,
          it seems more complex then polyhedral-schema.

          but we can also get heegaard-splitting from other picture of 3-manifold.

          we have :
          (polyhedral-schema -> heegaard-splitting)

******* 8.3.2 Heegaard Diagrams

        - A manifold which splits into handlebodies H1 H2
          is determined up to homeomorphism
          by the map (: h (-> [H1 boundary] [H2 boundary]))
          [which is determined by the images of the canonical meridians.]

          when a set of n disjoint simple closed curves
          on a handlebody of genus n is a Heegaard diagram?

          to get a heegaard-splitting of genus 1.

    - Nearly the entire body of research in the field
      is due to mathematicians who either are still alive
      or who were the teachers or senior colleagues of living mathematicians.
      This makes it possible to supplement the written tradition
      with oral information which is particularly valuable
      when dealing with questions of motivation
      for a particular investigation or of the transfer of ideas.

***** 2 The Foundation: Dyck's Group-Theoretical Studies

      - in Dyck's paper :
        For the further development of the present group theoretical problems
        the analytic (combinatorial) formulation has to replace every geometric description.
        However, the primary geometric interpretation has produced certain viewpoints
        and it is the purpose of the present paper
        to develop both their geometric version and their analytic content.

      - "a geometric concretization (Versinnlichung) of the group G."
        like the theory of fuchsian groups.

        tessellation of the hyperbolic disk

      - Burnside's textbooks.

      - De Siguier used Cantor's set theory
        and coined the term 'semigroup'.

      - What we called Proposition 1
        [there exist free group for a set of generators]
        is then what Dehn called the solution of the word problem for free groups.

***** 3 The Origin: The Theory of Discontinuous Groups

      - poincare and klein

      - discontinuous action
        discontinuous group acting on space

      - the early theory of discontinuous groups did not stimulate
        the development of the theory of group presentations,
        because the discontinuous groups are not primarily given by presentations.
        They are defined either by a set of generating elements
        which describe circle-preserving conformal self-mappings of the complex plane [geometric]
        or as a set of 2x2 matrices, subject to arithmetic conditions [arithmetic].

***** 5 The Graphical Representation of Groups

      - cayley diagram -> burnside [finite order] -> coxeter [finite order]

      - The point to be made here is that
        this is such an extremely simple definition
        when phrased in topological terms.
        Any possible translation into algebraic terms
        appears to be clumsy and opaque.
        Of course, one may say that
        all that matters about a definition is its precision.
        But this was certainly not Dehn's opinion.
        In a public talk for a nonmathematical academic audience,
        Dehn [1928] explained that the continued growth of mathematics
        requires the continued emergence of new ideas which reduce its complexity.
        He also expressed the hope that
        topology would renew its power through such an injection of new ideas.
        The reader should note the year when this was said.
        Within the following 10 years,
        there appeared monographs on topology by
        Alexandroff and Hopf,
        by Lefshetz, and by Seifert and Threlfall,
        documenting an upsurge in topological research which has not yet abated.

***** 7 Summary

      - Group theory started as the theory of groups of transformations,
        i.e., of one-to-one and onto self-mappings of a mathematical object.
        If the object is a finite set, the group appears as a permutation group.
        [Camille Jordan on "substitutions and algebraic equations"]

      - Infinite transformation groups
        became a topic of extensive research at about the same time.
        But this development was initiated not by a fundamental work but by a manifesto.
        [Felix Klein at Erlangen]
        [Sophus Lie]
        a program, according to which
        geometry should be considered from the point of view
        of transformation groups which act on certain spaces.

        for to get the generators of the group of Klein as in combinatorial group theory,
        the concept of generators has to be modified
        in the sense of Lie's "infinitesimal substitutions".

      - the tiling designs or tessellations
        of the euclidean or non-euclidean plane
        with a polygon as the basic tile,
        The generators and their inverses
        simply correspond to the edges of the basic polygonal tile,
        and the defining relations correspond to its vertices.

        this is the dual of the cayley-graph,
        so we have three graphs now,
        (1) underlying-space [classifying-space]
        (2) covering-space [cayley-graph]
        (3) acting-space [dual-cayley-graph]

      - finite group vs infinite group
        for finite group, we have :
        | finite group            | number            |
        | finite simple group     | prime number      |
        | direct product of group | product of number |
        but for infinite group, we do not have such.

      - The object on which a group of transformations acts
        has disappeared completely
        if we define a group through a presentation by generators and relations.

        while Poincare's fundamental group
        makes group generators and relations worth study.

      - the theory of representations of groups
        as linear transformations of finite-dimensional vector spaces

        [Frobenius Burnside, and L. E. Dickson]
        [linear groups over finite fields]

      - combinatorial group theory emphasis on algorithms.
        "to find a method of deciding in a finite number of steps"

      - combinatorial group theory
        geometric -> geometric interpretation
        algebraic -> classify and decomposition
