#+title: a new kind of science

* note

- program: setup rules for change

- computation: change directed rules (behavior)

- nature (the dao):
  nature is a simple programs produce great complexity

- program written by human:

  and the reason that such complexity is not usually seen in human artifacts
  is just that in building these we tend in effect to use programs
  that are specially chosen to give only behavior simple enough for us
  to be able to see that it will achieve the purposes we want.

  when human direct change, we often want simple predictable result.
