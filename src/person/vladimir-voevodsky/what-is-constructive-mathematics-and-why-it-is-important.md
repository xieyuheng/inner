When we say "constructive mathematics" we should first make clear
what we mean by the word "mathematics" in this phrase.

I am by training and by most of my life experience a pure mathematician.

For me to do mathematics means to invent or learn mathematical constructions
and then to use them to prove theorems that answer questions
that has been posed by other, mostly, more senior mathematicians.

- It is a kind of self-perpetuating activity,
  where we build on what our precursors have built.

- Starting from this view, one can realize the importance of correctness in mathematics,
  because we are building on what the previous generations have built,
  it is very important what they have built is actually correct,
  otherwise if someone discovers a mistake in something which has been done three generations ago,
  then so much have already been built upon it,
  it will lead to very big crash.

  We haven't so far experienced crashes of such big effects,
  but I have observed smaller crashes which destroy good mathematicians,
  because they built upon mistakes of previous generations,
  and they have advertise what they have built as a solution of Fermat's Last Conjecture,
  so the person was going to various forums and reporting the solution of the conjecture,
  until some people found something strange in what he was saying.
  Eventually he was made to look into the proof of the results
  which was published in a referee journal which he refered to.
  The proof turned out to be nonsense, and all his constructions failed.

  He is a friend of mine, it's no joke to me.
  It happend ten years ago, and he still can not get himself back into normal existence.

  So the correctness is extremely important.

  That is the road from which I came to the questions
  such as why constructive mathematics is important.

Therefore, mathematics for me consist of definitions and constructions,
assertions about these constructions and proofs of these assertions.

------

There is no real distinction between constructive and non-constructive assertions (statements).

The difference exists only between constructive and non-constructive constructions of proofs.

- It is funny to talk about "non-constructive constructions".

By the way, "non-constructive" is also called "classical",
and I will use this terminology as well.

------

Before we can approach the question about the importance of constructive mathematics,
that is, the importance of doing constructions and proofs in a certain way,
we might ask, since the audience consist mostly of non-mathematicians,
what is the importance of constructions and proofs in general?

------

Suppose we have a proof that the square root of 2 is not a rational number.
Why it is important?

- Mathematics touches the deep strings of human mind, of human motivation and behavior.

In fact it is so important that according to the legend
the person who have disclosed the proof
was thrown into the ocean from a ship.

- **[Xie]**
  If we understand knowledge as fixation of belief,
  than belief with proof can be considered as firmly fixed.

  Disclosing the proof, destroy people's deep belief that
  every number (every measure) can be represented by ratio.

------

The belief in mathematics as the basis of the structure of our world,
from simple one of Pythagoreans to string theory.

- There was always this dream of building up physics from mathematics.
  I had it when I was at high school age.

------

- When building up physics from mathematics,
  many models might be developed.

  The situation is even more interesting,
  because there are many mathematical realities.

Different methods of proof and construction that are
permitted by classical and constructive mathematics
lead to different mathematical realities.
Which one is the ultimate one behind our world?

- Some theorems can be proved in classical mathematics
  but can not be proved in constructive mathematics.

  In modern mathematics we often want to proof that
  two different definitions lead to the equivalent object.

  The reality of constructive mathematics is more complex
  than the reality of classical mathematics,
  because constructive mathematics can distinguish
  classically proved equivalence.

  Classical mathematics can be embedded in constructive mathematics.
  Classical mathematics can be viewed as an interesting subset of constructive mathematics.

  Proving in classical version can simplify things,
  one can first prototype one's proof in classical mathematics.

------

- It is important to use computer to verify correctness of proof.
  (Note that, we are interested in using computer to verify not to prove.)

  It is more convenient for a computer to verify constructive proof than classical proof.

  This is why constructive mathematics is important.

- This connection with proof verification,
  is different from the philosophical motivation
  in the history of the development of constructive mathematics
  which dates before the development of modern computer.
