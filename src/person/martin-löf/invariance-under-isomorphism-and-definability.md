# Invariance Under Isomorphism and Definability

- **[Xie]**
  Comparing how Martin-LÃ¶f talks about mathematics
  and how Vladimir Voevodsky talks about philosophy,
  I can sense some kind of personal disagreement between them.

  I am in line with Vladimir Voevodsky's attempt
  to develop categorical semantics (or more general algebraic semantics) for type theory.
