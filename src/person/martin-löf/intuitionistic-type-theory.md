# Explanations of the forms of judgement

- A : Set
- A = B : Set
- a : A
- a = b : A

# Propositions

Classically, a proposition is nothing but a truth value,
that is, an element of the set of truth values,
whose two elements are the true and the false.

Because of the difficulties of justifying the rules
for forming propositions
by means of quantification over infinite domains,
when a proposition is understood as a truth value,
this explanation is rejected by the intuitionists
and replaced by saying that,

- a proposition is defined
  by laying down what counts as a proof of the proposition,

- and that, a proposition is true if it has a proof,
  that is, if a proof of it can be given.

# Rules of equality
# Hypothetical judgements and substitution rules

- B : (-> :x : A -- Set)
- (-> :x : A -- :x B = :x D)
- (-> :x : A -- :x b : :x B)
- (-> :x : A -- :x b = :x d)

# Judgements with more than one assumption and contexts
# Sets and categories

- A category is defined by explaining
  what an object of the category is
  and when two such objects are equal.

- A category need not be a set,
  since we can grasp what it means
  to be an object of a given category
  even without exhaustive rules for forming its objects.

- examples :
  ``` jojo
  Set
  A
  (-> :x : A -- Set)
  (-> :x : A -- :x B)
  (# :x : A, :y : :x B)
  (-> :x : A, :y : :x B -- :x :y C)
  ```

- We will say 'object' of a category
  but 'element' of a set,
  which reflects the difference between categories and sets.

- To define a category
  it is not necessary to prescribe
  how its objects are formed,
  but just to grasp what an (arbitrary) object
  of the category is.

- Each set determines a category,
  namely the category of elements of the set,
  but not conversely :

  - for instance,
    the category of sets
    and the category of propositions are not sets,
    since we cannot describe
    how all their elements are formed.

- We can now say that
  a judgement is a statement to the effect that
  something is an object of a category,
  or that two objects of a category are equal.

- x -
  the author said (-> :x : A -- :x B)
  is a not set but a category,
  and (-> A -- B) is a set.

  which is not consistent.

  it would be better to only view
  inductively defined type as set.

# General remarks on the rules

- We now start to give the rules
  for the different symbols we use.
  We will follow a common pattern in giving them.
  For each operation we have four rules :
  1. set formation
  2. introduction
  3. elimination
  4. equality

- The formation rule says that
  we can form a certain set (proposition)
  from certain other sets (propositions)
  or families of sets (propositional functions).

- The introduction rules say
  what are the canonical elements
  (and equal canonical elements) of the set,
  thus giving its meaning.

- The elimination rule shows
  how we may define functions
  on the set defined by the introduction rules.

- The equality rules
  relate the introduction and elimination rules
  by showing how a function defined
  by means of the elimination rule
  operates on the canonical elements of the set
  which are generated by the introduction rules.

# Cartesian product of a family of sets

``` jojo
(-> :x : A -- :x B)
```

# Definitional equality

- type alias

# Applications of the cartesian product
# Disjoint union of a family of sets
# Applications of the disjoint union
# The axiom of choice

``` jojo
(+proof axiom-of-choice
  (-> :h : (-> :x : A -- :y : :x B, :x :y C)
   -- :f : (-> :x : A -- :x B)
      (-> :x : A -- :x :x :f C))
  {:h drop}
  {:h swap drop})

(+proof axiom-of-choice
  (-> :h : (-> :x : A -- :y : :x B, :x :y C)
   -- :f : (-> :x0 : A -- :x0 B)
      (-> :x1 : A -- :x1 :x1 :f C))
  {:h drop}
  {:h swap drop})
```

# The notion of such that
# Disjoint union of two sets
# Propositional equality

- I(A,a,b) is an internal form of =.

- x -
  one equality is the unification
  used in the implementation of the type system,
  while another equality is the unification
  exposed to the language been implemented.
