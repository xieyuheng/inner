* (1914) normal forms for one- and two-sided surfaces

*** 1

    - In view of the difficulties that are still to be overcome
      before normal forms can be obtained for manifolds
      of more than two dimensions,
      a simplified treatment of the analogous problem
      for closed surfaces may be worth mentioning.

    - connectivity, k, is defined as
      (k = 3 - x)
      thus, the k of sphere is 1.

*** i. combinatorial analysis situs and geometry.

    - [to be combinatorial]
      in combinatorial analysis situs,
      it is customary to think of a space
      not as an infinite aggregate of points,
      but rather as something determined by a partition
      composed of a finite number of interrelated entities, called cells.

      If K and L are two partitions of the same space
      we assume that it is always possible to
      transform one partition into the other
      by some finite sequence of operations of a definite, prescribed type.

      It is on the basis of this assumption
      that the theory is built up;
      consequently the theory rests on its own foundations
      and is quite independent of classical geometry.

    - three kind of theory
      1. combinatorial analysis situs
      2. rectilinear analysis situs
      3. general (point theoretical) analysis situs

    - [to be combinatorial in this paper]
      We may place the above interpretation
      on the treatment given in this paper
      if we regard a symbolic complex as a partition,
      a symbolic simplex as a cell
      (of a rather specialized type but involving no idea of "straightness"),
      and two equivalent complexes as different partitions of the same space.

    - x -
      一個抽象的理論 被作者認爲是 各種不同的具體的處理方式的 '解釋'

    - x -
      這裏的定義很清晰
      也很接近 AT1 對 cell-complex 的描述
      所以可以想象給 simple-complex 的理論也設計一個形式語言

    - k -
      之所以很清晰
      可能是因爲沒有把運算理解爲集合論的運算
      沒有把 complex 沒有被理解爲集合的集合
      而是把 complex 理解爲了 simplexes 的形式代數和

    - x -
      注意這裏的 simplex 是無定向的
      只所以有這種簡化 可能就是因爲沒有考慮定向

    - for simple-complexes,
      define
      1. congruent [very strong equivalent]
      2. partition
      3. equivalent [defined by partition and congruent]

*** iii. simple transformations.

    - simple transformations of order k (A, a)

    - x -
      just like a rewriting system.
