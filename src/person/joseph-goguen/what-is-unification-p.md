## about the definition of `cut` in cartesian closed category

- **[Xie]**
  after identify a substitution system as a category
  all the general concepts and constructions can be used
  to hunt for interesting and importent ideas in substitution system.

- **[Xie]**
  one of our problem is that,
  we can not view our stack simply as a functor,
  we are generalizing the definition of category itself.
  if we do so, we will not be able
  to use the general concepts and constructions in category theory,
  we have to generalize them too.
  the responsibilities goes to our side.

## postfix notation

- to make the syntax more close to natural usage,
  I translate the paper to postfix notation.
