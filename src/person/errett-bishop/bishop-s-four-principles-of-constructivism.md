# Bishop's Four Principles of Constructivism

**First.** Mathematics is common sense.

**Second.** Do not ask whether a statement is true until you know what it means.

**Third.** A proof is any completely convincing argument.

**Fourth.** Meaningful distinctions deserve to be maintained.

------

- **[Xie]** Do not forget that
  after knowing the meaning of the statement,
  one still needs an argument to be convinced.

- **[Xie]** Bishop's proof is subjective.

  Mechanicalized proof system does not give objectivity to truth,
  because the truth of a statement proved by a proof system,
  is based on the fact that, we, who uses the proof system,
  is convinced by the design and implementation of the proof system.
