*** (1939) simplicial spaces, nuclei, and m-groups

***** 1. introductory.

      - That is to say, a geometric, or set-theoretic, representation
        of an abstract group by a complex
        may be regarded as equivalent to an algebraic representation
        by a set of elements with a multiplication table.
        From this point of view an m-group is seen to be
        an automatic generalization of an abstract group.

      - x -
        whitehead 認爲所提出的理論是 group 這個概念的推廣
        因爲 每個 group 都可以對應一個空間
        而空間可以被推廣

***** 2. nuclei and m-groups.

      - [vertices]
        sets of undefined vertices {a, b, c, ...}

      - [n-simplex]
        Any set of n + 1 vertices (n >= — 1)
        will be called an (symbolic) n-simplex

      - [(symbolic) complex]
        a (symbolic) complex is any closed set of simplexes

      - [the algebra of complexex]
        we can define the following for complexes
        #+begin_src scheme
        (:= (+ X1 X2)
            (set/union X1 X2)
            (note looks like gluing))

        (:= (- X1 X2)
            (set/subtraction X1 X2))

        (:= (^ X1 X2)
            (set/intersection X1 X2))

        (note we have [idempotent]
              (= X (+ X X))
              (= X (^ X X)))

        (:= (: x (* X1 X2))
            (and (: x1 X1)
                 (: x2 X2)
                 (= x (set/union x1 x2))))

        (note we have [idempotent]
              (= X (* X X)))
        #+end_src

      - [idempotent]
        idempotent has set theoretical semantic,
        but the boundary operator seems not well defined in this semantic,
        and since a closed set of sets is determined by its top level elements,
        other informations are not needed at all.

      - [nilpotent]
        the semantic of nilpotent is without orientation.

      - x [production] -
        no matter nilpotent or idempotent,
        the production of simplexes is not the (* ...) of AT1
        but the a new kind of compositor called homotopy-join
        - (homotopy-join A B)
          for every two points in each A B,
          join them by a path, space form by such pathes is (homotopy-join A B).

      - [empty simplex]
        the set of an empty simplex is unique
        call it #1
        we have
        #+begin_src scheme
        (= (^ X #1) #1)
        (= (* X #1) X)
        #+end_src

      - [boundary of complexex]
        The boundaries which appear in this paper
        are calculated with residue classes mod 2 as coefficients
        #+begin_src scheme
        (:= [X boundary]
            [><><><])

        (:= #0 [#1 boundary])

        (note we have
              (= (+ X #0) X)
              (= (- X #0) X)
              (= (^ X #0) #0)
              (= (* X #0) #0))
        #+end_src

      - three equivalent classes
        defined by combinatorial [formal] transformations

        | simplicial space | sub-division                                  |
        | nuclei           | formal deformation (expansion or contraction) |
        | m-group          | filling or perforation                        |

        - note that,
          only (+ ...) and (* ...) are used in these definitions.

***** note about boundary operator

      - x -
        不論是 simplex 的定向
        還是這裏使用的 (mod 2)
        都是爲了使得 boundary boundary 等於 0

        這些理論都是給定了一些數據
        然後給定了一個確定的能夠從這些數據上算出邊界的算子

        然而在 AT1 中 我要做的是
        在把幾何元素實現爲數據的時候
        讓每個數據本身帶有完整的邊界信息
        這樣 對邊界的 '計算' 就稱不上是計算了

        在 (2 ...) 之類的語法關鍵詞中做複合的時候
        每一步都要指明複合所得的元素的邊界
        這個邊界信息在數據中被小心維護着

      - k -
        沒錯
        在定義 compositor 的時候
        也是需要指明所得的 compound 元素的邊界
        指明了邊界 就算是定義了一個 compositor 了

      - x -
        我們是否保證了 boundary boundary 爲 0 呢?
        我們是如何保證這一點的呢?
        首先對於 生成子
        我們已經小心檢查了它們的邊界
        使得對於生成子而言有 boundary boundary 爲 0
        甚至我們檢查的是更強的條件
        我們要求 n 階 生成子的邊界必須與 S-(n-1) 同倫等價
        這意味這 不光有這些邊界的 boundary 爲 0
        而且 (1) 它們是可定向的
        (2) 其 mapping-class-group 爲平凡的
        等等很多額外的條件

      - k -
        我們甚至還不知道那些條件能夠保證
        檢查的有效性
        即 能夠保證所合成的元素一定與 S-(n-1) 同倫等價
