## Abstract

When designing the algebraic structure of `adventure_t`,
my aim is to provide a model for dependent types,
where there is no distinction between function and type.

I designed this new algebraic structure,
because when using category theory as a model of dependent type theory,
one have to use complicated tricks to overcome the fact that
a category has a clear distinction between function (morphism) and type (object).

The structure has a universe of elements denoted as `elem_t`,
and an associative binary function on `elem_t` called `mul`,
and `mul` is simply denoted as juxtaposition (a special infix notation),
for example `mul(x, y)` is denoted as `x y`.

I use a special `error` element to overcome the partial-ness of `mul`,
the `error` element is an analog of `0` in the algebraic structure of number (ring).

In category theory there are two functions on `morphism_t`,
domain -- `dom : morphism_t -> object_t`,
and codomain -- `cod : morphism_t -> object_t`.

The above `dom` and `cod` is called `∂0` and `∂1` by some authors.
to help the readers to remember an analog between the pair of `(dom, cod)`
and the boundary operator of algebraic topology.

In my `adventure_t`, I use a single boundary operator `cut` to replace the two.

- Note that,
  before adding `cut` to `adventure_t`, it is a more simple ring-like structure,
  `cut` is a homomorphism from `elem_t` to `elem_t`.
  after adding `cut` to `adventure_t`,
  the morphism of the structure must also preserve `cut`.

In category theory composability between `f` and `g` is defined as `cod(f) == dom(g)`.

In my `adventure_t`, I use the `error` element to define non-composability.

## About `(- A)`

Note that `{ (- A) B (- C) D }` will always be `error`,
only `{ (- A) (- C) B D }` make sense,
thus maybe we should not break up `{ C A -> B D }` into `{ (- A) (- C) B D }`.

- **[Note]** The comment above makes the new algebraic structure not necessary,
  the new structure might also be not necessary in higher dimension,
  because in higher dimension we can introduce new shape of types other than arrows.

  And the new shape of types (such as polygon)
  might be composed in more than one ways (not like arrows).

- **[TODO]** We should study the theory of 2-groupoid first,
  which is a simple generalization of [Presentation of a group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_of_a_group).

- **[TODO]** Can we say that infinity-groupoid is the study of **non-directed** topological object,
  while infinity-category is the study of **directed** topological object (arrow is directed line).
  Specially, 2-category is the study of composition of **directed polygons**.

## Comparing to category theory

- can we use universal property in adventure?
  - "universal" is about "uniqueness" and "forall"
  - how to define `pair`?
    we need `not-eqv-t` to specify that
    `x * fst == error`
    if `x` is not a `pair`
  - we need `not-eqv-t` to specify that
    `a * (- b) == error`
    if `a != b`
  - it feels like in category theory
    more is in the syntax of arrow
    explicit syntax helps to define syntax-based equality
    which helps to specify when we can not compose arrow
    (when error will occur)

- how to specify a new jojo like `pair` and `branch`?
  - to specify `f`
    we need to specify `x * f` and `f * x` for all x
  - thus to specify `pair` we need curry

- what is a functor?
  a map that respect `mul` and `cut`?
  - (fun (x * y)) == ((fun x) * (fun y))
    (cut (fun x)) == (fun (cut x))
  - `quo` does not respect `mul`
    (quo (x * y)) != ((quo x) * (quo y))
  - `-` is a functor
    (- (x * y)) == ((- x) * (- y))
    (cut (- x)) == (- (cut x))

- terminal object
  - in category
    ``` js
    { A : type -> unique f : { A -> unit_t } }
    drop : { A : type -> { A -> unit_t } } = { _ : A -> unit }
    drop(A) = { _ : A -> unit } : { A -> unit_t }
    ```
    the uniqueness of universal property
    just means `drop` is a function
  - in adventure
    { A -> id } in jojo is { (- A) }
    ``` js
    { A : type -> drop(A) : { (- A) } }
    drop : { [A : type] { (- A) } }
    A drop : { (- A) }
    cut(A drop) == { (- A) }
    cut(drop) == { [A : type] { (- A) } }
    ```
    this means that we can use `(- A)`
    to recover category theory from adventure
  - existence of `id(A)` in category theory is
    ``` js
    id : { A : type -> A }
    ```
    in adventure
    ``` js
    // the above `id` it will be
    id : { [A : type] A }
    // we can define a more general `id` in adventure
    id : {} = {}
    // to express "do nothing" more generally without a type parameter
    ```
## Implementation

- Implementation can be viewed as
  - evaluation (interpretation) of expression (syntax object)
  - model of theory

- env and ctx
  - exp-t can form a adventure-t
  - val-t can form a adventure-t only in ctx
    - mul : elem-t -> elem-t -> elem-t
    - val-mul : (ctx-t) -> (val-t, val-t) -> (val-t, ctx-t)
      state monad where the state is ctx-t
  - eval is a functor from `exp-adventure` to `val-adventure in ctx`
    - how categorical semantics handles ctx?
  - syntax `exp-adventure` is amost the abstract class itself
    this is why abstract class is called syntax or language
  - so we have theory and model, just as in c-system
    and the model must be understand in ctx
