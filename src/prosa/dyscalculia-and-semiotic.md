Some person's brain is partly damaged,
so he can not understand the meaning of words, such as "give" and "take",
but he can still understand the meaning of words about number,
such as "two" and "eigth".

He has dyslexia but not dyscalculia.

So there must be two phrases during the cognition of words,
- first is to recognise words as sign or symbol,
- second is to interpret the meaning of the sign.
